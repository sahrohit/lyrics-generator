sequin smile, black lipstick
sensual politics
when you are young, they assume you know nothing

but i knew you
dancin' in your levi's
drunk under a streetlight, i
i knew you
hand under my sweatshirt
baby, kiss it better, i

and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite

a friend to all is a friend to none
chase two girls, lose the one
when you are young, they assume you know nothing
but i knew you
playing hide and seek and
giving me your weekends, i
i knew you
your heartbeat on the high line
once in twenty lifetimes, i

and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite

to kiss in cars and downtown bars
was all we needed
you drew stars around my scars
but now i'm bleedin'

'cause i knew you
steppin' on the last train
marked me like a bloodstain, i
i knew you
tried to change the ending
peter losing wendy, i
i knew you
leavin' like a father
running like water, i
and when you are young, they assume you know nothing
but i knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
i knew you'd haunt all of my what ifs
the smell of smoke would hang around this long
'cause i knew everything when i was young
i knew i'd curse you for the longest time
chasin' shadows in the grocery line
i knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
and you'd be standin' in my front porch light
and i knew you'd come back to me
you'd come back to me
and you'd come back to me
and you'd come back

and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite142embedshare urlcopyembedcopyi can see you standing, honey

when i passed your house
it's like i couldn't breathe

you heard the rumors from inez
you can't believe a word she says
most times, but this time it was true
the worst thing that i ever did
was what i did to you

but if i just showed up at your party
would you have me? would you want me?
would you tell me to go fuck myself
or lead me to the garden?
in the garden, would you trust me
if i told you it was just a summer thing?
i'm only seventeen, i don't know anything
but i know i miss you

betty, i know where it all went wrong
your favorite song was playing
from the far side of the gym
i was nowhere to be found
i hate the crowds, you know that
plus, i saw you dance with him

i was walking home on broken cobblestones
just thinking of you when she pulled up like
a figment of my worst intentions
she said "james, get in, let's drive"
those days turned into nights
slept next to her, but
i dreamt of you all summer long
betty, i'm here on your doorstep
and i planned it out for weeks now
but it's finally sinkin' in
betty, right now is the last time
i can dream about what happens when
you see my face again

the only thing i wanna do
is make it up to you
so i showed up at your party
yeah, i showed up at your party

yeah, i showed up at your party
will you have me? will you love me?
will you kiss me on the porch
in front of all your stupid friends?
if you kiss me, will it be just like i dreamed it?

you're not sure which is worse

because i dropped your hand while dancing
left you out there standing
crestfallen on the landing
champagne problems
your mom's ring in your pocket
my picture in your wallet
your heart was glass, i dropped it
champagne problems

you told your family for a reason
you couldn't keep it in
your sister splashed out on the bottle
now no one's celebrating

dom p rignon, you brought it
no crowd of friends applauded
your hometown skeptics called it
champagne problems
you had a speech, you're speechless
love slipped beyond your reaches
and i couldn't give a reason
champagne problems
your midas touch on the chevy door
november flush and your flannel cure
"this dorm was once a madhouse"
i made a joke, "well, it's made for me"
how evergreen, our group of friends
don't think we'll say that word again
and soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
that we once walked through
one for the money, two for the show
i never was ready so i watch you go
sometimes you just don't know the answer
'til someone's on their knees and asks you
"she would've made such a lovely bride
what a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
but you'll find the real thing instead
she'll patch up your tapestry that i shred

and hold your hand while dancing
never leave you standing
crestfallen on the landing
with champagne problems
your mom's ring in your pocket
her picture in your wallet
you won't remember all my
champagne problems
you won't remember all my
champagne problems75embedshare urlcopyembedcopyi'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
and if it was an open shut case
i never would've known from that look on your face
lost in your current like a priceless wine

the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man

life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
head on the pillow, i could feel you sneakin' in
as if you were a mythical thing
like you were a trophy or a champion ring
and there was one prize i'd cheat to win

the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans, that's my man
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
they count me out time and time again
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
but i come back stronger than a '90s trend

wait for the signal, and i'll meet you after dark
show me the places where the others gave you scars
now this is an open shut case
i guess i should've known from the look on your face
every bait and switch was a work of art

the more that you say, the less i know
wherever you stray, i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand

even on my worst day, did i deserve, babe
all the hell you gave me?
'cause i loved you, i swear i loved you
'til my dying day

i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
and you're the hero flying around, saving face
and if i'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
cursing my name, wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet

we gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
you know i didn't want to have to haunt you
but what a ghostly scene
you wear the same jewels that i gave you
as you bury me

i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'cause when i'd fight, you used to tell me i was brave
and if i'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
cursing my name, wishing i stayed

and i can go anywhere i want
anywhere i want, just not home
and you can aim for my heart, go for blood
but you would still miss me in your bones
and i still talk to you  when i'm screaming at the sky 
and when you can't sleep at night  you hear my stolen lullabies 

i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
and so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
you had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
cursing my name, wishing i stayed
you turned into your worst fears
and you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
crossing out the good years
and you're cursing my name, wishing i stayed

a string that pulled me
out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
chains around my demons
wool to brave the seasons
one single thread of gold
tied me to you

cold was the steel of my axe to grind
for the boys who broke my heart
now i send their babies presents
gold was the color of the leaves
when i showed you around centennial park
hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

gave me the blues and then purple pink skies

her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off st. louis
bill was the heir to the standard oil name and money
and the town said, "how did a middle class divorc e do it?"
the wedding was charming, if a little gauche
there's only so far new money goes
they picked out a home and called it "holiday house"
their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
the doctor had told him to settle down
it must have been her fault his heart gave out

and they said
"there goes the last great american dynasty
who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
there goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
she had a marvelous time ruining everything"

rebekah gave up on the rhode island set forever
flew in all her bitch pack friends from the city
filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
and blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
and losing on card game bets with dal 
and they said
"there goes the last great american dynasty
who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
there goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
she had a marvelous time ruining everything"

they say she was seen on occasion
pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
and in a feud with her neighbor
she stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
fifty years is a long time
holiday house sat quietly on that beach
free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
and then it was bought by me

see the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd

little did i know

that you were romeo, you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said, "stay away from juliet"
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you, "please don't go," and i said

romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say "yes"

so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story, baby, just say "yes"
romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
this love is difficult, but it's real
don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
it's a love story, baby, just say "yes"

oh, oh

i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town

and i said, "romeo, save me, i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you but you never come
is this in my head? i don't know what to think"
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"marry me, juliet, you'll never have to be alone
i love you, and that's all i really know
i talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

i see this for what it is
but now i'm right down in it, all the years i've given
is just shit we're dividin' up
showed you all of my hiding spots
i was dancing when the music stopped
and in the disbelief, i can't face reinvention
i haven't met the new me yet

there'll be happiness after you
but there was happiness because of you
both of these things can be true
there is happiness

past the blood and bruise
past the curses and cries
beyond the terror in the nightfall
haunted by the look in my eyes
that would've loved you for a lifetime
leave it all behind
and there is happiness

tell me, when did your winning smile
begin to look like a smirk?
when did all our lessons start to look like weapons
pointed at my deepest hurt?
i hope she'll be a beautiful fool
who takes my spot next to you
no, i didn't mean that
sorry, i can't see facts through all of my fury
you haven't met the new me yet
there'll be happiness after me
but there was happiness because of me
both of these things, i believe
there is happiness

in our history, across our great divide
there is a glorious sunrise
dappled with the flickers of light
from the dress i wore at midnight, leave it all behind
and there is happiness

i can't make it go away by making you a villain
i guess it's the price i paid for seven years in heaven
and i pulled your body into mine
every goddamn night, now i get fake niceties
no one teaches you what to do
when a good man hurts you
and you know you hurt him too

honey, when i'm above the trees
i see it for what it is
but now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
after giving you the best i had
tell me what to give after that
all you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
you haven't met the new me yet
and i think she'll give you that
there'll be happiness after you
but there was happiness because of you too
both of these things can be true
there is happiness

in our history, across our great divide
there is a glorious sunrise
dappled with the flickers of light
from the dress i wore at midnight, leave it all behind
oh, leave it all behind
leave it all behind

no, i could never give you peace

but i'm a fire and i'll keep your brittle heart warm

but i would die for you in secret
the devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
would it be enough if i could never give you peace?

your integrity makes me seem small
you paint dreamscapes on the wall
i talk shit with my friends, it's like i'm wasting your honor
and you know that i'd swing with you for the fences
sit with you in the trenches
give you my wild, give you a child
give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
family that i chose, now that i see your brother as my brother
is it enough?
but there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
i'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
but the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
but i'm a fire and i'll keep your brittle heart warm

drivin' the getaway car
we were flyin', but we'd never get far  don't pretend 
don't pretend it's such a mystery
think about the place where you first met me
ridin' in a getaway car
there were sirens in the beat of your heart  should've known 
should've known i'd be the first to leave
think about the place where you first met me
in a getaway car, oh oh oh
no, they never get far, oh oh ahh
no, nothing good starts in a getaway car

i was ridin' in a getaway car
i was cryin' in a getaway car
i was dyin' in a getaway car
said goodbye in a getaway car
ridin' in a getaway car
i was cryin' in a getaway car
i was dyin' in a getaway car

but something 'bout it felt like home somehow
and i left my scarf there at your sister's house
and you've still got it in your drawer, even now

oh, your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze
we're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days

and i know it's long gone and
that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay, but i'm not fine at all
oh, oh, oh

'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
wind in my hair, i was there
i remember it all too well

photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
and your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
you tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
and i know it's long gone and
there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to

'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing  round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs, i was there
i remember it all too well, yeah

maybe we got lost in translation
maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you tore it all up
running scared, i was there
i remember it all too well
and you call me up again
just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause i remember it all, all, all
too well
time won't fly, it's like i'm paralyzed by it
i'd like to be my old self again, but i'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well

wind in my hair, you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there
you remember it all
it was rare, i was there
i remember it all too well122embedshare urlcopyembedcopykeep your helmet, keep your life, son

but you ruined her in a year
don't act like it was hard
and you swear you didn't know  didn't know 
no wonder why you didn't ask
she was sleepin' in your clothes  in your clothes 
but now she's got to get to class

how dare you?
and how could you?
will you only feel bad when they find out?
if you could take it all back
would you?

try not to abuse your power
i know we didn't choose to change
you might not wanna lose your power
but havin' it's so strange

i thought that i was special
you made me feel
like it was my fault, you were the devil
lost your appeal
does it keep you in control?  in control 
for you to keep her in a cage?
and you swear you didn't know  didn't know 
you said you thought she was your age

how dare you?
and how could you?
will you only feel bad if it turns out
that they kill your contract?
would you?

try not to abuse your power
i know we didn't choose to change
you might not wanna lose your power
but power isn't pain

mmm

"i'll never let you go," five words you'll never say  aww 
i laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
if three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away  hahahahahahahaha 

i just wanna make you feel okay
but all you do is look the other way
i can't tell you how much i wish i didn't wanna stay
i just kinda wish you were gay

is there a reason we're not through?
is there a 12 step just for you?
our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys"  hey, hey, hey, hey 
ten fingers tearin' out my hair
nine times you never made it there
i ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
 yay 

how am i supposed to make you feel okay
when all you do is walk the other way?
i can't tell you how much i wish i didn't wanna stay
i just kinda wish you were gay

to spare my pride
to give your lack of interest an explanation
don't say i'm not your type
just say that i'm not your preferred sexual orientation
i'm so selfish
but you make me feel helpless, yeah
and i can't stand another day
stand another day

i just wanna make you feel okay
but all you do is look the other way, hmm
i can't tell you how much i wish i didn't wanna stay
i just kinda wish you were gay

i'd leave alone
just goes to show
that the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
we were a pair
but i saw you there
too much to bear
you were my life, but life is far away from fair
was i stupid to love you?
was i reckless to help?
was it obvious to everybody else?

you were never on my side
fool me once, fool me twice
are you death or paradise?
now you'll never see me cry
there's just no time to die

another lesson yet to learn

i've never fallen from quite this high
fallin' into your ocean eyes

to write myself a letter
to tell me what to do, mm mm
do you read my interviews?
or do you skip my avenue?
when you said you were passin' through
was i even on your way?
i knew when i asked you to  when i asked you to 
be cool about what i was tellin' you
you'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do  what you said you'd do

you call me again, drunk in your benz
drivin' home under the influence
you scared me to death, but i'm wastin' my breath
'cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
i don't relate to you

'cause i'd never treat me this shitty
you made me hate this city

and i don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
and all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
so don't waste the time i don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
i could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but i'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
never paid any mind to my mother or friends
so i shut 'em all out for you 'cause i was a kid

you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone  fuck you 
 ah

and that's about the only thing they share

i'm in their secondhand smoke
still just drinking canned coke
i don't need a xanny to feel better
on designated drives home
only one who's not stoned
don't give me a xanny, now or ever

can you check your uber rating? oh my god
 and it's like, wait, like, when? 

wakin' up at sundown  ooh 
they're late to every party  ooh 
nobody's ever sorry  ooh 
too inebriated now to dance
morning as they come down  come down 
their pretty heads are hurting  hurting 
they're awfully bad at learning  learning 
make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

i'm in their secondhand smoke
still just drinking canned coke
i don't need a xanny to feel better
on designated drives home
only one who's not stoned
don't give me a xanny, now or ever

please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
on your cigarette break
i can't afford to love someone
who isn't dying by mistake in silver lake

what is it about them?

they just keep doin' nothing
too intoxicated to be scared
hmm, hmm

when we talk, you say it softly
but i love it when you're awfully quiet
hmm mm, quiet

could be a little greater
show me what you could make her
you'll never know until you try it
hmm mm
and you don't have to keep it quiet

and i know it makes you nervous
but i promise you, it's worth it
to show 'em everything you kept inside
don't hide, don't hide
too shy to say, but i hope you stay
don't hide away
come out and play

look up, out of your window
see snow, won't let it in though
leave home, feel the wind blow

but we can't change the weather
when the weather's come and gone
books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards
you'll single out the wrong words
like you mishear all my songs

you'll hear "stay" and "blah blah blah"
you just want what you can't have
no way
i'll call the cops
if you don't stop, i'll call your dad

and i hate to do this to you on your birthday
happy birthday by the way

i'm not your party favorour time is up
your eyes are shut
i won't get to tell you what
i needed you to know
it's dark enough
the moonlight doesn't show
and all my love
could never bring you home

there's no more stars to find
and i'm too far behind
and i'd love to let you go
i'd love to let you go
you're all that's on my mind
i called a thousand times
and i have to let you go
but i love you more and more than you could know

i sat alone
awaited your reply
was driven home
when i started to cry
i should've known
i should've said goodbye
i only hoped
i would've had more time

there's no more stars to find
and i'm too far behind
and i'd love to let you go
i'd love to let you go
you're always on my mind
when i called a thousand times
and i have to let you go
but i love you more and more than you could know oh

oh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
da da da da da, da da ra da
we're both too young
to live and die this way
a sunny summer day
with so much left to say
not 21
the 18th out of pain
the day you couldn't stay
you made me wanna pray
but i think god's fake

there's no more stars to find
and i'm too far behind
and i'd love to let you go
i'd love to let you go
you're all that's on my mind
when i called a thousand times
and i have to let you go
but i love you more and more and more and more and more
more and more, more and more and more than you will ever know
you will never know
you will never knowplease, please
don't leave  me
be

it's not true
take me to the rooftop
told you not to worry
what do you want from me?
don't ask questions
wait a minute
don't you know i'm no good for you?
baby, i don't feel so good
and all the good girls go  to hell
bite my tongue, bide my time
what is it about them?
i'm the bad guybreathe the air again, it's a beautiful day
i wish this moment would stay with the earth
some primal paradise
but there you go again, saying everything ends
saying you can't depend on anything, or anyone

if the end of the world was near
where would you choose to be?
if there was five more minutes of air
would you panic and hide
or run for your life
or stand here and spend it with me
if we had five more minutes
would i, could i, make you happy?

and we would live again
in the simplest of ways
living day after day
like some primal animals
we would love again
under glorious suns
with the freedom that comes with the truth

if the end of the world was near
where would you choose to be?
if there was five more minutes of air
would you panic and hide?
or run for your life?
or stand here and spend it with me?
if we had five more minutes
would i, could i, make you happy?

so it finally came to pass
i saw the end of the world
saw the madness unfold like
some primal burial
and i looked back upon
armageddon
and the moment of truth
between you and me

if we had five more minutes of air to breathe
and we cried all through it
but you spent them with me
on our last few drags of air we agree
i was and you were happyhome alone, tryin' not to eat
distract myself with pornography
i hate the way she looks at me
i can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
that satisfied, it's a male fantasy
i'm goin' back to therapy

'cause i loved you then and i love you now
and i don't know how
guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
if i'm getting over you
or just pretending to
be alright, convince myself i hate you

 want me to sing in here? 
 okay 

i got a call from a girl i used to know
we were inseparabl  years ago
thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
and it's all i think about wh n i'm behind the wheel
i worry this is how i'm always gonna feel
but nothing lasts, i know the deal

but i loved you then and i love you now
and i don't know how
guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
if i'm getting over you
or just pretending to
be alright, convince myself i hate you

can't get over you
no matter what i do
i know i should, but i could never hate yousomething's in the 

something's in the air right now
like i'm losin' track of time  time, time 
like i don't really care right now
but maybe that's fine
you weren't even there that day
i was waitin' on you  you, you 
i wonder if you were aware that day
was the last straw for me and i knew

i sent you flowers
did you even care?
you ran the shower
and left them by the stairs
ooh ooh ooh, a a a ayy
thought you had your shit together, but damn, i was wrong  wrong 

you ain't nothin' but a lost cause  cause, cause 
and this ain't nothin' like it onc  was  was, was 
i know you think you're such an outlaw
but you got no job  job 
you ain't nothin' but a lost cause  cause 
and this ain't nothin' lik  it once was  was 
i know you think you're such an outlaw
but you got no job

i used to think you were shy  shy 
but maybe you just had nothing on your mind
maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
i used to wish you were mine  mine 
but that was way before i realized
someone like you would always be so easy to find
 so  so easy  so, so 
hee, mm mm mm, mm

gave me no flowers
wish i didn't care
you'd be gone for hours
could be anywhere
ooh ooh ooh
ah ah ah ah ah
thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong  wrong 

you ain't nothing but a lost cause  cause 
and this ain't nothing like it once was  was 
i know you think you're such an outlaw  yeah 
but you got no job  no job 
you ain't nothing but a lost cause  cause 
and this ain't nothing like it once was  was 
i know you think you're such an outlaw  think you're such a lost cause 
but you got no job

 what did i tell you? 
 don't get complacent 
 it's time to face it now, na na, na na, na na 
 what did i tell you? 
 don't get complacent 
 it's time to face it now, na na, na na, na na can't take it back once it's been set in motion
you know i love to rub it in like lotion
if you only pray on sunday, could you come my way on monday?
'cause i like to do things god doesn't approve of if she saw us

she couldn't look away, look away, look away
she'd wanna get involved, involved, involved
and what would people say, people say, people say
if they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?

i can see it clear as day
you don't really need a break
wanna see what you can take
you should really run away

i wanna do bad things to you  to you 
i wanna make you yell  yell 
i wanna do bad things to you  to you 
don't wanna treat you well  well 

can't take it back once it's been set in motion
you know i need you for the oxytocin
if you find it hard to swallow, i can loosen up your collar
'cause as long as you're still breathing
don't you even think of leaving

not gonna wanna look away, look away, look away
you're gonna wanna get involved, involved, involved
and what would people say, people say, people say
if they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?

i can see it clear as day
you don't really need a break
wanna see what you can take
you should really run away
other people wouldn't stay
other people don't obey
you and me are both the same
you should really run away

bad things
to you
i wanna do bad things to you
i wanna make you yell
i wanna do bad things to you
don't wanna treat you wellmm mm mm, mm mm
na na na

love when it comes without a warning
'cause waiting for it gets so boring
a lot can change in twenty seconds
a lot can happen in the dark
love when it makes you lose your bearings
some information's not for sharing
use different names at hotel check ins
it's hard to stop it once it starts  it starts 

i'm not sentimental
but there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm
makes me wanna take a picture
make a movie with you that we'd have to hide

you better lock your phone  oh 
and look at me wh n you're alone
won't take a lot to g t you goin'  oh 
i'm sorry if it's torture though
i know, i know

it might be more of an obsession
you really make a strong impression  you sure do 
nobody saw me in the lobby  saw me in the lobby 
nobody saw me in your arms, mm

i'm not sentimental
but there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm  'bout the way you look tonight 
makes me wanna make 'em jealous
i'm the only one who does it how you like  only one who does it how you  

you better lock your phone  oh 
and look at me when you're alone  you're alone, you're alone 
won't take a lot to get you goin'  get me goin', get me goin' 
i'm sorry if it's torture though  torture though 
i know, i know
you better lock your door  oh 
and look at me a little more
we both know i'm worth waitin' for  waitin' for 
that heavy breathin' on the floor  on the floor 
i'm yours, i'm yours  i'm yours 

i'm not sentimental
i'm not sentimental
i'm not sentimentali'm gettin' older, i think i'm agin' well
i wish someone had told me i'd be doin' this by myself
there's reasons that i'm thankful, there's a lot i'm grateful for
but it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
than anyone before  anyone before 
too bad they're usually deranged

last week, i realized i crave pity
when i retell a story, i make everything sound worse
can't shake the feeling that i'm just bad at healing
and maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
which is ironic because when i wasn't honest
i was still bein' ignored  lyin' for attention just to get neglection 
now we're estranged

things i once enjoyed
just keep me employed now
things i'm longing for
someday, i'll be bored of
it's so weird
that we care so much until we don't

i'm gettin' older, i've got more on my shoulders
but i'm gettin' better at admitting when i'm wrong
i'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
to keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'cause, to be honest, i just wish that what i promise
would depend on what i'm given, mmm  not on his permission 
 wasn't my decision  to be abused, mmm

things i once enjoyed
just keep me employed now, mmm
things i'm longing for, mmm
someday, i'll be bored of
it's so weird
that we care so much until we don't

but next week, i hope i'm somewhere laughin'
for anybody asking, i promise i'll be fine
i've had some trauma, did things i didn't wanna
was too afraid to tell ya, but now, i think it's timei don't want it
and i don't want to want you
but in my dreams, i seem to be more honest
and i must admit you've been in quite a few

halley's comet
comes around more than i do
but you're all it takes for me to break a promise
silly me to fall in love with you

i haven't slept since sunday
midnight for me is 3am for you
but my sleepless nights are better
with you than nights could ever be alone, ooh ooh
i was good at feeling nothin', now i'm hopeless
what a drag to love you like i do
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

i've been loved before, but right now, in this moment
i feel more and more like i was mad  for you
for you


i'm sitting in my brother's room
haven't slept in a week or two, or two
i think i might hav  fallen in love
what am i to do?when i was older
i was a sailor on an open sea
but now i'm underwater
and my skin is paler than it should ever be
hmm

i'm on my back again
dreaming of a time and place
where you and i remain the best of friends
even after all this ends
can we pretend?
i'm on my, i'm on my back again
it's seeming more and more
like all we ever do is see how far it bends
before it breaks in half and then
we bend it back again

guess i got caught in the middle of it
yes i've been taught, got a little of it
in my blood, in my blood
memories burn like a forest fire
heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud
in the flood

when i was older
i was a sailor on an open sea
but now i'm underwater
and my skin is paler than it should ever be

i'm watching movies back to back in black and white, i never
seen anybody do it like i do it any better
been goin' over you, i'm overdue for new endeavors
nobody lonely like i'm lonely and i don't know whether
you'd really like it in the limelight
you'd sympathize with all the bad guys
i'm still a victim in my own right
but i'm the villain in my own eyes, yeah

when i was older
i was a sailor on an open seaokay
mm mm, i

i didn't change my number
i only changed who i reply to
laura said i should be nicer
but not to you
i love a "you mad at me?" text
shoulda guessed
that you would think i was upset  haha 
you're obsessed

don't take it out on me
i'm out of sympathy for you
maybe you should leave
before i get too mean

i didn't change my number
i only changed who i believe in
you were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes  eyes, ey s 
but looks can be deceivin'
i gotta work, i go to work
you don't d serve to feel so hurt
you got a lot of fuckin' nerve
i don't deserve, so

don't take it out on me
i'm out of sympathy for you
maybe you should leave
before i get too mean
and take it out on you
and your best friend, too
i should have left when drew
said you were bad news

mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mm
mm mm mmdo you know me?
really know me?
you have opinions about my opinions
about my music
about my clothes
about my body
some people hate what i wear
some people praise it
some people use it to shame others
some people use it to shame me
but i feel you watching
always
and nothing i do goes unseen
so while i feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
if i lived by them, i'd never be able to move
would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
would you like me to be quiet?
do my shoulders provoke you? does my chest?
am i my stomach? my hips?
the body i was born with
is it not what you wanted?
if i wear what is comfortable, i am not a woman
if i shed the layers, i'm a slut
though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
and judge me for it
why?
we make assumptions about people based on their size
we decide who they are
we decide what they're worth
if i wear more, if i wear less
who decides what that makes me? what that means?
is my value based only on your perception?
or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?"he hath come to the bosom of his beloved

and everybody said it was a letdown
i was only built like everybody else now
but i didn't get a surgery to help out
'cause i'm not about to redesign myself now, am i?
 am i?  am i?
all these other inanimate bitches, it's none of my business
but don't you get sick of posin' for pictures
with that plastic body?

man, i'm overheated, can't be defeated
can't be deleted, can't un believe it
i'm overheated, can't be defeated
can't be deleted, can't be repeated
i'm overheatedeverybody dies, surprise, surprise
we tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
to make it feel like we might be right
we might not be alone
be alone

"everybody dies," that's what they say
and maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
i just wonder why you'd wanna stay
if everybody goes
you'd still be alone

i don't wanna cry, some days i do
but not about you
it's just a lot to think about the world i'm used to
the one i can't get back, at l ast not for a while
i sure have a knack for seein' lif  more like a child
it's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
everybody dies
and when will i?

you oughta know
that even when it's time, you might not wanna go
but it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
but you are not alone
you are not unknownanother story of girl meets boy, and gets destroyed, uh, oh
another promise broken in two, the lucky view of fiction

fade away, fade away
teach me how to fade away
another story of girl meets boy

he's okay, she's broken
he's the ocean waves, she's chokin'
fade away, fade away
teach me how to fade away
another story of girl meets boy

so picture perfect, it can't be real and all you feel is numb
you see them talking but hear no sound to hit the ground
and fade

he's okay, she's broken
he's the ocean waves, she's chokin'

don't want it, don't need it
don't want it
don't want it, don't need it

don't need it, don't, don't need it
don't need it, don't, don't need it
don't need it, don't, don't need itin the end, when they're all gone
when the world is silent and the days are long
just you and i, we'll be alive
we made it on our own

'cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
and everybody wants to think they won't
'cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
and everybody seems to think they won't, they won't, they won't, they won't

maybe i'm still alive but my heart is beating slow
baby, tell me i gotta know
are you okay? you seem too far gone
infected, standing there all alone

'cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
and everybody wants to think they won't
and everybody makes it 'till they don't
and everybody seems to think they won't, they won't, they won't, they won't

the best of me, the best of me is you
the best of me, the best of me was you

whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
ladum, badum, mmmmi'm not crying on the phone when you call
what's the use in begging you to stay?
i'm not trying to save us anymore
cut me loose, 'cause you're too far away

to make me feel better, make it alright
to give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
seven days in limbo, push me out the window
nothing in common, nothing to lose
nothing but problems between me and you
with your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
seven days

i'll give all my weapons to you
we've said it all, no more bones to break
i'm done thinking that we might just spark enough
we're broken glass waiting to be washed away

can't make me feel better, make it alright
give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
seven days in limbo, push me out the window
nothing in common, nothing to lose
nothing but problems between me and you
with your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo
seven days

if you love me, let me go
if you love me, leave limbo

can't make me feel better, make it alright
can't give me your sweater, hold my hand tight
seven days in limbo, just push me out the window
nothing in common, nothing to lose
nothing but problems between me and you
with your arms akimbo, seven days in limbo

nobody was really sure if he was from the house of lords

i saw a film today, oh boy

a crowd of people turned away
but i just had to look

woke up, fell out of bed
dragged a comb across my head
found my way downstairs and drank a cup

found my coat and grabbed my hat
made the bus in seconds flat
found my way upstairs and had a smoke
and somebody spoke and i went into a dream

there lived a young boy named rocky raccoon
and one day his woman ran off with another guy
hit young rocky in the eye
rocky didn't like that
he said, "i'm gonna get that boy"
so one day he walked into town
booked himself a room in the local saloon

and rocky raccoon checked into his room
only to find gideon's bible
but rocky had come equipped with a gun
to shoot off the legs of his rival

his rival it seems had broken his dreams
by stealing the girl of his fancy
her name was magill, and she called herself lil
but everyone knew her as nancy
now, she and her man, who called himself dan
were in the next room at the hoe down
and rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
he said, "danny boy, this is a showdown"
but daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
and rocky collapsed in the corner

now the doctor came in stinking of gin
and proceeded to lie on the table
he said, "rocky, you met your match"
and rocky said, "doc, it's only a scratch
and i'll be better, i'll be better, doc, as soon as i am able"

and now rocky raccoon, he fell back in his room
only to find gideon's bible
gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
to help with good rocky's revival

we had five years left to cry in  cry in

earth was really dying  dying 
cried so much his face was wet
then i knew he was not lying  lying 
i heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
i saw boys, toys, electric irons and tvs
my brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
i had to cram so many things to store everything in there
and all the fat, skinny people
and all the tall, short people
and all the nobody people
and all the somebody people
i never thought i'd need so many people

a girl my age went off her head
hit some tiny children
if the black hadn't have pulled her off
i think she would have killed them
a soldier with a broken arm
fixed his stare to the wheels of a cadillac
a cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
and a queer threw up at the sight of that
i think i saw you in an ice cream parlour
drinking milkshakes cold and long
smiling and waving and looking so fine
don't think you knew you were in this song
and it was cold and it rained, so i felt like an actor
and i thought of ma and i wanted to get back there
your face, your race
the way that you talk
i kiss you, you're beautiful
i want you to walk

and drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest
first they give you everything that you want
then they take back everything that you have
they live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
they can work with satan while they dress like the saints
they know god exists for the devil told them so
they scream my name aloud down into the well below
here i am, not quite dying
my body left to rot in a hollow tree
its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
and the next day, and the next, and another day
here i am, not quite dying
my body left to rot in a hollow tree
its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
and the next day, and the next, and another day
here i am, not quite dying

immersed in crowley's uniform
of imagery
i'm living in a silent film
portraying himmler's sacred realm
of dream reality
i'm frightened by the total goal
drawing to the ragged hole
and i ain't got the power anymore
no i ain't got the power anymore

i'm the twisted name on garbo's eyes
living proof of churchill's lies
i'm destiny
i'm torn between the light and dark
where others see their targets
divine symmetry
should i kiss the viper's fang
or herald loud the death of man
i'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
and i ain't got the power anymore
don't believe in yourself
don't deceive with belief
knowledge comes with death's release
ah 
ah 

i'm not a prophet or a stone age man
just a mortal with potential of a superman
i'm living on
i'm tethered to the logic of homo sapien
can't take my eyes from the great salvation
of bullshit faith
if i don't explain what you ought to know
you can tell me all about it
on the next bardo
i'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
and i ain't got the power anymore

don't believe in yourself
don't deceive with belief

the elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
onto the street below, oh tarzan, go man go

sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
wrecked up and paralysed, diamond dogs are stabilised

the regular crowd shuffles in
there's an old man sittin' next to me
makin' love to his tonic and gin
he says, "son, can you play me a memory?
i'm not really sure how it goes
but it's sad, and it's sweet, and i knew it complete
when i wore a younger man's clothes"

now john at the bar is a friend of mine
he gets me my drinks for free
and he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
but there's someplace that he'd rather be
he says, "bill, i believe this is killing me"
as the smile ran away from his face
"well i'm sure that i could be a movie star
if i could get out of this place"
oh, la, la la, di dee da
la la, di dee da, da dum

now paul is a real estate novelist
who never had time for a wife
and he's talkin' with davy, who's still in the navy
and probably will be for life
and the waitress is practicing politics
as the businessmen slowly get stoned
yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
but it's better than drinkin' alone


sing us a song, you're the piano man
sing us a song tonight
well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright

it's a pretty good crowd for a saturday
and the manager gives me a smile
'cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
to forget about life for a while
and the piano, it sounds like a carnival
and the microphone smells like a beer
and they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
and say, "man, what are you doin' here?"

brenda and eddie were the popular steadies
and the king and the queen of the prom
riding around with the car top down
and the radio on
nobody looked any finer
or was more of a hit at the parkway diner
we never knew we could want
more than that out of life
surely brenda and eddie
would always know how to survive

brenda and eddie were still going steady
in the summer of '75
when they decided their marriage
should be at the end of july
everyone said they were crazy
"brenda you know that you're much too lazy
and eddie could never afford
to live that kind of life."
oh but there we were waving
brenda and eddie goodbye
well, they got an apartment
with deep pile carpets
and a couple of paintings from sears
a big waterbed that they
bought with the bread
they had saved for a couple of years
they started to fight
when the money got tight
and they just didn't count on the tears

yeah, rock and roll 

well, they lived for a while in a very nice style
but it's always the same in the end
they got a divorce as a matter of course
and they parted the closest of friends
then the king and the queen
went back to the green
but you can never go back there again

brenda and eddie had had it already
by the summer of '75
from the high to the low
to the end of the show
for the rest of their lives
they couldn't go back to the greasers
the best they could do
was pick up their pieces
we always knew they would
both find a way to get by

can't tell you more 'cause i told you already

we had no cameras to shoot the landscape

i took on diesel
back in montauk yesterday
left this morning from
the bell in gardiners bay
like all the locals here
i've had to sell my home
too proud to leave
i work my fingers to the bone

so i could own my downeaster "alexa"
and i go where the ocean is deep
there are giants out there in the canyons
and a good captain can't fall asleep
i got bills to pay
and children who need clothes
i know there's fish out there
but where? god only knows
they say these waters
aren't what they used to be
but i got people back on land
who count on me
so if you see my downeaster "alexa"
and if you work with the rod and the reel
tell my wife i am trolling atlantis
and i still have my hands on the wheel

yay o

now i drive my downeaster "alexa"
more and more miles
from shore every year
since they told me i can't sell no stripers
and there's no luck
in swordfishing here

i go walking in my sleep
from the mountains of faith
to a river so deep
i must be looking for something
something sacred i lost
but the river is wide
and it's too hard to cross

and even though i know
the river is wide
i walk down every evening
and i stand on the shore
and try to cross to the opposite side
so i can finally find
what i've been looking for

in the middle of the night
i go walking in my sleep
through the valley of fear
to a river so deep
and i've been searching for something
taken out of my soul
something i would never lose
something somebody stole
i don't know why i go walking at night
but now i'm tired and i don't
want to walk anymore
i hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
until i find what it is
that i've been looking for

in the middle of the night
i go walking in my sleep
through the jungle of doubt
to a river so deep
i know i'm searching for something
something so undefined
that it can only be seen
by the eyes of the blind
in the middle of the night

i'm not sure about a life after this
god knows i've never
been a spiritual man
baptized by the fire
i wade into the river
that runs to the promised land
in the middle of the night
i go walking in my sleep
through the desert of truth
to the river so deep
we all end in the ocean
we all start in the streams
we're all carried along
by the river of dreams

and never saw his father anymore
a child of sacrifice, a child of war
another son who never
had a father after leningrad

went off to school
and learned to serve the state
followed the rules
and drank his vodka straight
the only way to live was drown the hate
a russian life was very sad
and such was life in leningrad

i was born in '49
a cold war kid in mccarthy time
stop 'em all at the 38th parallel
blast those yellow reds to hell
cold war kids were hard to kill
under their desks in an air raid drill
haven't they heard we won the war
what do they keep on fighting for?
viktor was sent to some red army town
served out his time
became a circus clown
the greatest happiness he'd ever found
was making russian children glad
and children lived in leningrad

children lived in levittown
hid in the shelters underground
until the soviets turned their ships around
and tore the cuban missiles down
and in that bright october sun
we knew our childhood days were done
and i watched my friends go off to war
what do they keep on fighting for?

and so my child and i came to this place
to meet him eye to eye and face to face
he made my daughter laugh
then we embraced
we never knew what friends we had
until we came to leningrad8embedshare urlcopyembedcopyi've seen the lights go out on broadway
i saw the empire state lay low
and life went on beyond the palisades
they all bought cadillacs and left there long ago
they held a concert out in brooklyn
to watch the island bridges blow
they turned our power down and drove us underground
but we went right on with the show

i've seen the lights go out on broadway
i saw the ruins at my feet
you know we almost didn't notice it
we'd seen it all the time on 42nd street
they burned the churches up in harlem
like in that spanish civil war
the flames were everywhere, but no one really cared
it always burned up there before

i've seen the lights go out on broadway
i watched the mighty skyline fall
the boats were waiting at the battery
the union went on strike
they never sailed at all
they sent a carrier out from norfolk
and picked the yankees up for free
they said that queens could stay
they blew the bronx away
and sank manhattan out at sea

you know those lights were bright on broadway
but that was so many years ago
before we all lived here in florida
before the mafia took over mexico

there are not many who remember
they say a handful still survive
to tell the world about the way the lights went out
and keep the memory alive1embedshare urlcopyembedcopythey say that these are not the best of times
but they're the only times i've ever known
and i believe there is a time for meditation
in cathedrals of our own
now i have seen that sad
surrender in my lover's eyes
and i can only stand apart and sympathize
for we are always
what our situations hand us
it's either sadness or euphoria

so we'll argue and we'll compromise
and realize that nothing's ever changed
for all our mutual experience
our separate conclusions are the same
now we are forced
to recognize our inhumanity
our reason coexists with our insanity
and though we choose
between reality and madness
it's either sadness or euphoria

how thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
perhaps we don't fulfill each others fantasies
and as we stand upon the ledges of our lives
with our respective similarities
it's either sadness or euphoria

good way to reassure

tell her about it
let her know how much you care
when she can't be with you
tell her you wish you were there
tell her about it
every day before you leave
pay her some attention
give her something to believe

cause now and then she'll get to worrying
just because you haven't spoken for so long
though you may not have done anything
will that be a consolation when she's gone?
listen boy it's good information
from a man who's made mistakes
just a word or two that she gets from you
could be the difference that it makes

she's a trusting soul
she's put her trust in you
but a girl like that won't tell you
what you should do

tell her about it
tell her everything you feel
give her every reason to accept
that you're for real
tell her about it
tell her all your crazy dreams
let her know you need her
let her know how much she means

tell her about it
tell her how you feel right now
just tell her about it
the girl don't want to wait too long
you got to tell her about it
tell her now that you won't go wrong
you got to tell her about it
before it gets too late
you've got to tell her about it
you know the girl don't want to wait
you got to tell her about it
you got to tell, tell, tell her about it
now, tell her about it4embedshare urlcopyembedcopyif it seems like i've been lost

knew his name

from utah to oklahoma
and the law just could not seem
to track him down

for the folks they loved to tell
'bout when billy the kid came to town
2:42   3:39

well, one cold day a posse captured billy
and the judge said, "string him up
for what he did."
and the cowboys and their kin
like the sea came pouring in
to watch the hanging of billy the kid

and he never traveled heavy
yes he always rode alone
and he soon put many older guns to shame
and he never had a sweetheart

i saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
yeah, you look happier, you do

ain't nobody hurt you like i hurt you
but ain't nobody love you like i do
promise that i will not take it personal, baby
if you're moving on with someone new

'cause baby you look happier, you do
my friends told me one day i'll feel it too
and until then i'll smile to hide the truth
but i know i was happier with you

sat in the corner of the room
everything's reminding me of you
nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
you're happier, aren't you?
oh, ain't nobody hurt you like i hurt you
but ain't nobody need you like i do
i know that there's others that deserve you
but my darling, i am still in love with you

but i guess you look happier, you do
my friends told me one day i ll feel it too
i could try to smile to hide the truth
but i know i was happier with you

 cause baby you look happier, you do
i knew one day you d fall for someone new
but if he breaks your heart like lovers do
just know that i ll be waiting here for you102embedshare urlcopyembedcopyi took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
i threw the day old tea from the cup
packed up the photo album matthew had made
memories of a life that's been loved
took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
poured the old ginger beer down the sink
dad always told me, "don't you cry when you're down"
but mum, there's a tear every time that i blink

oh, i'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but i know
a heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

so i'll sing hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
when i fell down you'd be there holding me up
spread your wings as you go
when god takes you back
he'll say, "hallelujah, you're home"

i fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
john says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
and wiped a tear from the side of my face
i hope that i see the world as you did 'cause i know
a life with love is a life that's been lived

so i'll sing hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
when i fell down you'd be there holding me up
spread your wings as you go
when god takes you back
he'll say, "hallelujah, you're home"

i know you will still love me the same
'cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
and baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
and i'm thinking 'bout how
people fall in love in mysterious ways
and maybe it's all part of a plan
well i'll just keep on making the same mistakes
hoping that you'll understand
that, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart, i'm thinking out loud
and maybe we found love right where we are

i met her on grafton street right outside of the bar
she shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
she asked me what does it mean, the gaelic ink on your arm?
said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
she took jamie as a chaser, jack for the fun
she got arthur on the table with johnny riding a shotgun
chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
then put van on the jukebox, got up to dance

after dancing the c ili singing to trad tunes

a cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat

i was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
as we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

she said, "don't you worry if i disappear"
i told her i'm not really looking for another mistake
i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jumped right in a week later, returned
i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me, "i was never looking for a friend
maybe you could swing by my room around ten
baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
we'll be in between the sheets till the late am"
baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing
don't  hhh  with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't  hhh  with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe
and for a couple weeks, i only wanna see her
we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
before, a text message was the only way to reach her
now she's staying at my place and loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha, all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep, i guess that i don't want to either
but, me and her, we make money the same way
four cities, two planes, the same day
and those shows have never been what it's about
but maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
i'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
but we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
wish i'd have written it down, the way that things played out
when she was kissing him, how i was confused about
now she should figure it out, while i'm sat here singing
don't  hhh  with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't  hhh  with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe
 knock, knock, knock  on my hotel door
i don't even know if she knows what for
she was crying on my shoulder, i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next  get lost 
but you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
and i never saw him as a threat  get lost 
until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
it's not like we were both on tour
we were staying on the same  hhh  hotel floor
and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun, and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realized what you wanted
it's a bit too much, too late, if i'm honest
and all this time, god knows i'm singing
don't  hhh   with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't  hhh  with my love
i told her she knows

the paving stones i played upon that kept me on the grind
so blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride

i chased the pictured perfect life, i think they painted it wrong
i think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell

keepin' up with kylie and kim
in the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him

there were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
they haunt this dusty beach road
in the skeleton frames of burned out chevrolets

and in the lonely cool before dawn
you hear their engines roaring on
but when you get to the porch they're gone on the wind

and the magic rat drove his sleek machine
over the jersey state line
barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a dodge
drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
the rat pulls into town rolls up his pants
together they take a stab at romance
and disappear down flamingo lane

well the maximum lawman run down flamingo
chasing the rat and the barefoot girl
and the kids round here look just like shadows
always quiet, holding hands
from the churches to the jails
tonight all is silence in the world
as we take our stand down in jungleland

well the midnight gangs assembled
and picked a rendezvous for the night
they'll meet 'neath that giant exxon sign
that brings this fair city light
man there's an opera out on the turnpike
there's a ballet being fought out in the alley
until the local cops, cherry top, rips this holy night
the street's alive as secret debts are paid
contact's made, they vanished unseen
kids flash guitars just like switch blades
hustling for the record machine
the hungry and the hunted
explode into rock'n'roll bands
that faced off against each other out in the street
down in jungleland

in the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the dj plays
lonely hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
desperate as the night moves on
just one look and a whisper, and they're gone


beneath the city two hearts beat
soul engines running through a night so tender
in a bedroom locked in whispers
of soft refusal and then surrender
in the tunnels uptown the rat's own dream guns him down
as shots echo down them hallways in the night
no one watches when the ambulance pulls away
or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light
outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
between what's flesh and what's fantasy
and the poets down here
don't write nothing at all
they just stand back and let it all be
and in the quick of the night they reach for their moment
and try to make an honest stand
but they wind up wounded, not even dead
tonight in jungleland10embedshare urlcopyembedcopyyeah

running for our lives at night on them backstreets
slow dancing in the dark

huddled in our cars
waiting for the bells that ring
in the deep heart of the night

to go

taking it on them backstreets together

endless juke joints and valentino drag
where dancers scraped the tears
up off the street dressed down in rags
running into the darkness

you could hear the whole damn city crying
blame it on the lies that killed us
blame it on the truth that ran us down
you can blame it all on me terry

when the breakdown hit at midnight
there was nothing left to say
but i hated him
and i hated you when you went away

just another tramp of hearts
crying tears of faithlessness

we were rubbing our eyes
our mouths were dry from the sugar and the popcorn
and we felt a little guilty
about spending that whole sunny day inside
the movie we were watching
about bonnie and clyde
they were driving down a backroad
they thought they were home free
the police knew they were coming
they were hiding in the trees
and they shot them down
one hundred and thirty rounds
they shot them down

so we might as well say
what's on our minds
'cause there's no way to know
when it's your time to go
when it's your time to go

later we were walking on the streets of monterey
the trees beside the water
reminded you of childhood holidays
hey babe, i know the way
to a little stretch of beach
where we could lose ourselves
don't matter where you've been
you jump into the water and you come out clean
don't matter where you've been

like the back of my hand knew the roads
i swerved my bike and lost control
over the handles in the air
a lady who came walking by found me lying there
and the nurse at the hospital said

"little boy, don't be scared
now your father is waiting in the next room
little boy, don't be sad
now your mom's on her way, you'll be out of here soon"

we drove so slowly through these streets
in the suburbs of our dreams
at night my father closed his eyes
he saw the new car in the drive
my mother standing in the doorway
friday night, a smile on her face
and the voice i can hear in my head

"little boy, don't be scared
now you know we'll be sleeping in the next room
little boy, don't be sad
now tomorrow is as it is coming 'round soon"
we only need a little space
just somewhere we could call our place
my mother standing in the doorway
friday night, a smile on her face
these things always start so small
with no applause and no drum roll

ooh ohh, ooh ohh
ooh ohh, ooh ohh89embedshare urlcopyembedcopyi was in the winter of my life
and the men i met along the road were my only summer
at night i fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them
three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me
and my only real happy times
i was a singer
not a very popular one
i once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
but upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky
that i wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
but i didn t really mind because i knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is
when the people i used to know found out what i had been doing how i had been living, they asked me why, but there s no use in talking to people who have a home
they have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people
for home to be wherever you lie your head
i was always an unusual girl
my mother told me that i had a chameleon soul
no moral compass pointing due north
no fixed personality
just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
and if i said i didn t plan for it to turn out this way i d be lying
because i was born to be the other woman
who belonged to no one
who belonged to everyone
who had nothing
who wanted everything
with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that i couldn t even talk about it
and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me

every night i used to pray that i d find my people
and finally i did
on the open road
we had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore
except to make our lives into a work of art
live fast
die young
be wild
and have fun
i believe in the country america used to be
i believe in the person i want to become
i believe in the freedom of the open road
and my motto is the same as ever
"i believe in the kindness of strangers"
and when i'm at war with myself
i ride
i just ride
who are you?
are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?
i have
i am fucking crazy
but i am free75embedshare urlcopyembedcopyin the car, in the car, in the backseat, i'm your baby

would like to think that you would stick around
you know that i d just die to make you proud
the taste, the touch, the way we love
it all comes down to make the sound of our love song

dream a dream, here's a scene
touch me anywhere  cause i'm your baby
grab my waist, don't waste any part
i believe that you see me for who i am
so spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
oh, be my once in a lifetime

the baffled king composing "hallelujah"

hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah

your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
she tied you to a kitchen chair
she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah

hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
you say i took the name in vain
i don't even know the name
but if i did, well really, what's it to ya?
there's a blaze of light in every word

hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
i did my best, it wasn't much
i couldn't feel, so i tried to touch
i've told the truth, i didn't come to fool ya

i'll stand before the lord of song
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

i know this room, i've walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew you
and i've seen your flag on the marble arch
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me, do you?
and remember when i moved in you
the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah
maybe there's a god above
but all i've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah76embedshare urlcopyembedcopyif you are the dealer

you can hear the boats go by
you can spend the night beside her
and you know that she's half crazy
but that's why you want to be there
and she feeds you tea and oranges
that come all the way from china
and just when you mean to tell her
that you have no love to give her
then she gets you on her wavelength
and she lets the river answer
that you've always been her lover

and you want to travel with her
and you want to travel blind
and you know that she will trust you
for you've touched her perfect body with your mind

and jesus was a sailor
when he walked upon the water
and he spent a long time watching
from his lonely wooden tower
and when he knew for certain
only drowning men could see him
he said "all men will be sailors then
until the sea shall free them"
but he himself was broken
long before the sky would open
forsaken, almost human
he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
and you want to travel with him
and you want to travel blind
and you think maybe you'll trust him
for he's touched your perfect body with his mind

now suzanne takes your hand
and she leads you to the river
she is wearing rags and feathers
from salvation army counters
and the sun pours down like honey
on our lady of the harbour
and she shows you where to look
among the garbage and the flowers
there are heroes in the seaweed
there are children in the morning
they are leaning out for love
and they will lean that way forever
while suzanne holds the mirror

and you want to travel with her

she said that you gave it to her

your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
you'd been to the station to meet every train
but then you came home without lili marlene

to a flake of your life
and when she came back
she was nobody's wife
well, i see you there with the rose in your teeth

he'll say one day you caused his will
to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
and then taking from his wallet
an old schedule of trains, he'll say
"i told you when i came i was a stranger
i told you when i came i was a stranger"
but now another stranger seems
to want you to ignore his dreams
as though they were the burden of some other
o you've seen that man before
his golden arm dispatching cards
but now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger
and he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter
ah you hate to watch another tired man
lay down his hand
like he was giving up the holy game of poker
and while he talks his dreams to sleep
you notice there's a highway
that is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
it's curling just like smoke above his shoulder
you tell him to come in sit down
but something makes you turn around
the door is open, you can't close your shelter
you try the handle of the road
it opens do not be afraid
it's you my love, you who are the stranger
it is you my love, you who are the stranger
"well, i've been waitin', i was sure
we'd meet between the trains we're waitin' for
i think it's time to board another
please understand, i never had a secret chart
to get me to the heart of this
or any other matter"
when he talks like this you don't know what he's after
when he speaks like this you don't know what he's after
"let's meet tomorrow if you choose
upon the shore, beneath the bridge
that they are building on some endless river"
then he leaves the platform
for the sleeping car that's warm
you realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
and it comes to you, he never was a stranger
and you say, "ok, the bridge or someplace later"
and then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
you find he did not leave you very much not even laughter
like any dealer he was watching for the card
that is so high and wild
he'll never need to deal another
he was just some joseph looking for a manger
he was just some joseph looking for a manger
and then leaning on your window sill
he'll say one day you caused his will

a thousand kisses deep

and then consented to be wrecked

they heard that my body was free
then i took the dust of a long sleepless night
and i put it in your little shoe
and then i confess that i tortured the dress
that you wore for the world to look through
i showed my heart to the doctor: he said i just have to quit
then he wrote himself a prescription
and your name was mentioned in it 
then he locked himself in a library shelf
with the details of our honeymoon
and i hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse
and his practice is all in a ruin
i heard of a saint who had loved you
so i studied all night in his school
he taught that the duty of lovers
is to tarnish the golden rule
and just when i was sure that his teachings were pure
he drowned himself in the pool
his body is gone but back here on the lawn
his spirit continues to drool

he'd recently taken of you

yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control
it begins with your family, but soon it comes round to your soul
well i've been where you're hanging, i think i can see how you're pinned:
when you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned
well they lay down beside me, i made my confession to them
they touched both my eyes and i touched the dew on their hem
if your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn
they will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem
when i left they were sleeping, i hope you run into them soon
don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon
and you won't make me jealous if i hear that they sweetened your night:

in the cave at the tip of the lily
in some hallway where love's never been
on a bed where the moon has been sweating
in a cry filled with footsteps and sand

with a garland of freshly cut tears?
ay, ay, ay, ay
take this waltz, take this waltz
take this waltz it's been dying for years
there's an attic where children are playing
where i've got to lie down with you soon
in a dream of hungarian lanterns
in the mist of some sweet afternoon
and i'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
all your sheep and your lilies of snow

with its very own breath of brandy and death
dragging its tail in the sea

i'll be wearing a river's disguise
the hyacinth wild on my shoulder
my mouth on the dew of your thighs
and i'll bury my soul in a scrapbook
with the photographs there, and the moss
and i'll yield to the flood of your beauty
my cheap violin and my cross
and you'll carry me down on your dancing
to the pools that you lift on your wrist

your prisoner wine and bread
you met him at some temple
where they take your clothes at the door
he was just a numberless man in a chair
who'd just come back from the war
and you wrap up his tired face in your hair
and he hands you the apple core
then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare
of all the kisses we put on some time before
and he gave you a german shepherd to walk
with a collar of leather and nails
and he never once made you explain or talk
about all of the little details
such as who had a word and who had a rock
and who had you through the mails
now your love is a secret all over the block
and it never stops not even when your master fails
and he took you up in his aeroplane
which he flew without any hands
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain
that drove the crowd from the stands
then he killed the lights in a lonely lane
and an ape with angel glands
erased the final wisps of pain
with the music of rubber bands
and now i hear your master sing
you kneel for him to come
his body is a golden string
that your body is hanging from
his body is a golden string
my body has growin' numb
oh now you hear your master sing
your shirt is all undone
and will you kneel beside this bed
that we polished so long ago
before your master chose instead
to make my bed of snow?
your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
and you're speaking far too low
no i can't make out what your master said
before he made you go
now i think you're playing far too rough
for a lady who's been to the moon;
i've lain by this window long enough
to get used to an empty room
and your love is some dust in an old man's cough
who is tapping his foot to a tune
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much

now i loved your master perfectly
i taught him all that he knew
he was starving in some deep mystery
like a man who is sure what is true
and i sent you to him with my guarantee
i could teach him something new
and i taught him how you would long for me
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do
now i believe that you heard your master sing

what happens to the heart
there's a mist of summer kisses
where i tried to double park
the rivalry was vicious
and the women were in charge
it was nothing, it was business
but it left an ugly mark
so i've come here to revisit

i was selling holy trinkets
i was dressing kind of sharp
had a pussy in the kitchen
and a panther in the yard
in the prison of the gifted
i was friendly with the guard
so i never had to witness

i should have seen it coming
you could say i wrote the chart
just to look at her was trouble
it was trouble from the start
sure we played a stunning couple
but i never liked the part
it ain't pretty, it ain't subtle
what happens to the heart
now the angel's got a fiddle
and the devil's got a harp
every soul is like a minnow
every mind is like a shark
i've opened every window
but the house, the house is dark
just say uncle, then it's simple
what happens to the heart
i was always working steady
but i never called it art
the slaves were there already
the singers chained and charred
now the arc of justice bending
and the injured soon to march
i lost my job defending
what happens to the heart
i studied with this beggar
he was filthy he was scarred
by the claws of many women
he had failed to disregard
no fable here no lesson
no singing meadowlark
just a filthy beggar blessing
what happens to the heart
i was always working steady
but i never called it art
i could lift, but nothing heavy
almost lost my union card
i was handy with a rifle
my father's .303

not the right to disagree

ah we're drinking and we're dancing
and the band is really happening
and the johnny walker wisdom running high
and my very sweet companion
she's the angel of compassion
she's rubbing half the world against her thigh
and every drinker every dancer
lifts a happy face to thank her
the fiddler fiddles something so sublime
all the women tear their blouses off
and the men they dance on the polka dots
and it's partner found, it's partner lost
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:
it's closing time
yeah the women tear their blouses off
and the men they dance on the polka dots
and it's partner found, it's partner lost
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:
it's closing time
ah we're lonely, we're romantic
and the cider's laced with acid
and the holy spirit's crying, "where's the beef?"
and the moon is swimming naked
and the summer night is fragrant
with a mighty expectation of relief
so we struggle and we stagger
down the snakes and up the ladder
to the tower where the blessed hours chime
and i swear it happened just like this:
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
the gates of love they budged an inch
i can't say much has happened since
but closing time
i swear it happened just like this:
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
the gates of love they budged an inch
i can't say much has happened since
but closing time, closing time
i loved you for your beauty
but that doesn't make a fool of me:
you were in it for your beauty too
and i loved you for your body
there's a voice that sounds like god to me
declaring, declaring, declaring that your body's really you
and i loved you when our love was blessed
and i love you now there's nothing left
but sorrow and a sense of overtime
and i missed you since the place got wrecked
and i just don't care what happens next
looks like freedom but it feels like death
it's something in between, i guess
it's closing time
yeah i missed you since our place got wrecked
by the winds of change and the weeds of sex
looks like freedom but it feels like death
it's something in between, i guess
it's closing time
yeah we're drinking and we're dancing
but there's nothing really happening
and the place is dead as heaven on a saturday night
and my very close companion
gets me fumbling gets me laughing
she's a hundred but she's wearing
something tight
and i lift my glass to the awful truth
which you can't reveal to the ears of youth
except to say it isn't worth a dime
and the whole damn place goes crazy twice
and it's once for the devil and it's once for christ
but the boss don't like these dizzy heights
we're busted in the blinding lights
of closing time
the whole damn place goes crazy twice
and it's once for the devil and it's once for christ

that's a jew's harp on the table
that's a crayon in his hand
and the corners of the blueprint are ruined since they rolled
far past the stems of thumbtacks

and the skylight is like skin for a drum i'll never mend

i met a lady, she was playing with her soldiers in the dark
oh one by one she had to tell them
that her name was joan of arc
i was in that army, yes i stayed a little while
i want to thank you, joan of arc
for treating me so well
and though i wear a uniform i was not born to fight
all these wounded boys you lie beside
goodnight, my friends, goodnight
i came upon a wedding that old families had contrived
bethlehem the bridegroom
babylon the bride
great babylon was naked, oh she stood there trembling for me
and bethlehem inflamed us both
like the shy one at some orgy
and when we fell together all our flesh was like a veil
that i had to draw aside to see
the serpent eat its tail
some women wait for jesus, and some women wait for cain
so i hang upon my altar
and i hoist my axe again
and i take the one who finds me back to where it all began
when jesus was the honeymoon
and cain was just the man
and we read from pleasant bibles that are bound in blood and skin
that the wilderness is gathering
all its children back again
the rain falls down on last year's man
an hour has gone by
and he has not moved his hand
but everything will happen if he only gives the word
the lovers will rise up
and the mountains touch the ground

thanks for the dance
i hear that we're married
one two three, one two three, one

it was almost a daughter or a son
and there's nothing to do
but to wonder if you
are as hopeless as me
and as decent
we're joined in the spirit
joined at the hip
joined in the panic
wondering if
we've come to some sort
of agreement
it was fine, it was fast
we were first, we were last
in line at the
temple of pleasure
but the green was so green
and the blue was so blue
i was so i

as she came riding through the dark
no moon to keep her armour bright
no man to get her through this very smoky night
she said, "i'm tired of the war
i want the kind of work i had before
a wedding dress or something white
to wear upon my swollen appetite"
well, i'm glad to hear you talk this way
you know i've watched you riding every day
and something in me yearns to win
such a cold and lonesome heroine
"and who are you?" she sternly spoke
to the one beneath the smoke
"why, i'm fire", he replied
"and i love your solitude, i love your pride"
"then fire, make your body cold
i'm going to give you mine to hold"
saying this she climbed inside
to be his one, to be his only bride
and deep into his fiery heart
he took the dust of joan of arc
and high above the wedding guests
he hung the ashes of her wedding dress
it was deep into his fiery heart
he took the dust of joan of arc
and then she clearly understood
if he was fire, oh then she must be wood
i saw her wince, i saw her cry
i saw the glory in her eye
myself, i long for love and light
but must it come so cruel, and oh so bright?2embedshare urlcopyembedcopy intro 

baby, i've been waiting
i've been waiting night and day
i didn't see the time
yeah i waited half my life away
there were lots of invitations
and i know you sent me some
but i was waiting
for the miracle, for the miracle to come

i know you really loved me
but, you see, my hands were tied
i know it must have hurt you
it must have hurt your pride
to have to stand beneath my window
with your bugle and your drum
and me i'm up there waiting
for the miracle, for the miracle to come

yeah, i don't believe you'd like it
you wouldn't like it here
there ain't no entertainment
and the judgements are severe
the maestro says it's mozart
but it sounds like bubble gum
when you're waiting
for the miracle, for the miracle to come
waiting for the miracle
there's nothing left to do
i haven't been this happy
since the end of world war ii

nothing left to do
when you know that you've been taken
nothing left to do
when you're begging for a crumb
nothing left to do
when you've got to go on waiting
waiting for the miracle to come

yeah i dreamed about you, baby
it was just the other night
most of you was naked
ah but some of you was light
the sands of time were falling
from your fingers and your thumb
and you were waiting
for the miracle, for the miracle to come

ah baby, let's get married
we've been alone too long
let's be alone together
let's see if we're that strong
yeah let's do something crazy
something absolutely wrong
while we're waiting
for the miracle, for the miracle to come
nothing left to do
when you know you've been taken
nothing left to do
when you're begging for a crumb
nothing left to do
when you've got to go on waiting
waiting for the miracle to come

when you've fallen on the highway
and you're lying in the rain
and they ask you how you're doing
of course you'll say you can't complain   
if you're squeezed for information
that's when you've got to play it dumb:
you just say you're out there waiting
for the miracle, for the miracle to come

i ache in the places where i used to play
and i'm crazy for love but i'm not coming on
i'm just paying my rent every day
in the tower of song
i said to hank williams, ''how lonely does it get?''
hank williams hasn't answered yet
but i hear him coughing all night long
oh, a hundred floors above me
in the tower of song
i was born like this, i had no choice
i was born with the gift of a golden voice
and twenty seven angels from the great beyond
they tied me to this table right here
in the tower of song
so you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
i'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
i'm standing by the window where the light is strong
ah they don't let a woman kill you
not in the tower of song
now you can say that i've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
the rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
and there's a mighty judgement coming, but i may be wrong
you see, you hear these funny voices
in the tower of song
i see you standing on the other side
i don't know how the river got so wide
i loved you baby, way back when
and all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
but i feel so close to everything that we lost
we'll never, we'll never have to lose it again
now i bid you farewell, i don't know when i'll be back
there moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
but you'll be hearing from me baby, long after i'm gone
i'll be speaking to you sweetly from a window
in the tower of song
yeah my friends are gone and my hair is grey

and i didn't feel like very much
i said to myself, "where are you golden boy
where is your famous golden touch?"
i thought you knew where
all of the elephants lie down
i thought you were the crown prince
of all the wheels in ivory town
just take a look at your body now
there's nothing much to save
and a bitter voice in the mirror cries
"hey, prince, you need a shave."
now if you can manage to get
your trembling fingers to behave
why don't you try unwrapping
a stainless steel razor blade?

that's right, it's come to this
yes it's come to this
and wasn't it a long way down
wasn't it a strange way down?

there's no hot water
and the cold is running thin
well, what do you expect from
the kind of places you've been living in?
don't drink from that cup
it's all caked and cracked along the rim
that's not the electric light, my friend
that is your vision growing dim
cover up your face with soap, there
now you're santa claus
and you've got a gift for anyone
who will give you his applause
i thought you were a racing man
ah, but you couldn't take the pace
that's a funeral in the mirror
and it's stopping at your face
that's right, it's come to this
yes it's come to this
and wasn't it a long way down
wasn't it a strange way down?

once there was a path
and a girl with chestnut hair
and you passed the summers
picking all of the berries that grew there
there were times she was a woman
oh, there were times she was just a child
and you held her in the shadows
where the raspberries grow wild
and you climbed the twilight mountains
and you sang about the view
and everywhere that you wandered
love seemed to go along with you
that's a hard one to remember
yes it makes you clench your fist
and then the veins stand out like highways
all along your wrist

that's right, it's come to this
yes it's come to this
and wasn't it a long way down
wasn't it a strange way down?
you can still find a job
go out and talk to a friend
on the back of every magazine
there are those coupons you can send
why don't you join the rosicrucians
they will give you back your hope
you can find your love with diagrams
on a plain brown envelope
but you've used up all your coupons
except the one that seems
to be written on your wrist
along with several thousand dreams
now santa claus comes forward
that's a razor in his mit
and he puts on his dark glasses
and he shows you where to hit
and then the cameras pan

my father he came in, i was nine years old
and he stood so tall above me
blue eyes they were shining
and his voice was very cold
said, "i've had a vision
and you know i'm strong and holy
i must do what i've been told."
so he started up the mountain
i was running, he was walking
and his ax was made of gold
well, the trees they got much smaller
the lake a lady's mirror
we stopped to drink some wine
then he threw the bottle over
broke a minute later
and he put his hand on mine
thought i saw an eagle
but it might have been a vulture
i never could decide
then my father built an altar
he looked once behind his shoulder
he knew i would not hide
you who build the altars now
to sacrifice these children
you must not do it anymore
a scheme is not a vision
and you never have been tempted
by a demon or a god
you who stand above them now
your hatchets blunt and bloody
you were not there before
when i lay upon a mountain
and my father's hand was trembling
with the beauty of the word
and if you call me brother now
forgive me if i inquire
"just according to whose plan?"
when it all comes down to dust
i will kill you if i must
i will help you if i can

that wasn't what i heard
for the sake of conversation
i took her at her word
the lights went out behind us
the fireflies undressed
the broken sidewalk ended
i touched her sleeping breasts
they opened to me urgently
like lilies from the dead
behind a fine embroidery
her nipples rose like bread
then i took off my necktie
and she took off her dress
my belt and pistol set aside
we tore away the rest
the night of santiago
and i was passing through
so i took her to the river
as any man would do
her thighs they slipped away from me
like schools of startled fish
though i've forgotten half my life
i still remember this
now, as a man i won't repeat
the things she said aloud
except for this, my lips are sealed forever
and for now
and soon there's sand in every kiss
and soon the dawn is ready
and soon the night surrenders
to a daffodil machete
i gave her something pretty
and i waited till she laughed
i wasn't born a gypsy
to make a woman sad
the night of santiago
and i was passing through
i took her to the river
as any man would do
the night of santiago
and i was passing through
i took her to the river
as any man would do
i didn't fall in love of course
it's never up to you
but she was walking back and forth
and i was passing through
when i took her to the river
in her virginal apparel
when i took her to the river
on that night of santiago
and yes she lied about it all
her children and her husband
you were born to judge the world
forgive me but i wasn't

it will be forever
or i'll never fall in love

it will be completely
or i'll never give my heart

you feel that way too

steals across the meadows of my heart
high up in the sky the little stars climb
always reminding me that we're apart
you wander down the lane and far away
leaving me a song that will not die
love is now the stardust of yesterday
the music of the years gone by
sometimes i wonder why i spend
the lonely night dreaming of a song
the melody haunts my reverie
and i am once again with you
when our love was new
and each kiss an inspiration
but that was long ago
now my consolation
is in the stardust of a song
beside a garden wall
when stars are bright
you are in my arms
the nightingale tells his fairy tale
a paradise where roses bloom
though i dream in vain
in my heart it will remain
my stardust melody

that used to be there, you could see where they'd been washed away
by too many through the day

then you came along with your siren of song
to tempt me to madness
i thought for a while that your poignant smile
was tinged with the sadness
of a great love for me
ah yes, i was wrong
again
i was wrong
life is lonely again
and only last year
everything seemed so sure
now life is awful again

could only be a bore
a week in paris will ease the bite of it
all i care is to smile in spite of it

while yet you are still

stifling those who strive

in some small dive
and there i'll be

one thing consists of consistence
and it's that we're all battling fear

oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
i liked it better when my car had sound
there are things we can do
but from the things that work there are only two
and from the two that we choose to do
peace will win and fear will lose
and there's faith and there's sleep
we need to pick one please because
faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
and for us to think is to be alive

can't stop thinking about if and when i die
for now i see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries
for "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow
and one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
we're surrounded and we're hounded
there's no above, or under, or around it
for "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
and "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
for if and when we go above, the question still remains
are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
and that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
but until that time, i'll try to sing this

if i keep moving, they won't know
i'll morph to someone else

he's got no friends close but those who know him most know
he goes by nico, he told me i'm a copy
when i'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
there's no above or a secret door
what are we here for
if not to run straight through all our tormentors?

we glorify those even more when they...

we give 'em the highest of praise

i could give up, and boost up my reputation

they would host and post a celebration

don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
but for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
could we give this some room for a new point of view?
and could it be true that some could be tempted
to use this mistake as a form of aggression?
a form of succession?
a form of a weapon?
thinking "i'll teach them"
well, i'm refusing the lesson
it won't resonate in our minds
i'm not disrespecting what was left behind
just pleading that it does not get glorified
maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high

'cause the next moment before you know it
time is slowin' and it's frozen still
and the windowsill looks really nice, right?
you think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?
fight it, take the pain, ignite it
tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine
and tie it to a tree tell it, "you belong to me
this ain't a noose, this is a leash
and i have news for you, you must obey me "

why am i not scared in the morning?

they told me i was gone, they told me i was gone

do i threaten all your plans? i'm insignificant"
please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
i will set my soul on fire, what have i become?
i'll tell 'em
on the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
as the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
the start of a day when we put on our face
a mask that portrays that we don't need grace
on the eve of a day that is bigger than us
but we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
and the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
desperately yelling, "there's something we need "
i'm not free, i asked forgiveness three times
same amount that i denied, i three time mvp'd this crime
i'm afraid to tell you who i adore
won't tell you who i'm singing towards
metaphorically, i'm a whore, and that's denial number four

a time in everyone's life
when nothing seems to go your way
where nothing seems to turn out right
there may come a time
you just can't seem to find your place
and for every door you open
seems like you get two slammed in your face

that's when you need someone
someone that you, you can call
when all your faith is gone
it feels like you can't go on

let it be me
let it be me
if it's a friend you need
let it be me
let it be me

when it feels like you're always comin' up last
pockets full of nothin' ain't got no cash
no matter where you turn
you ain't got no place to stand
you reach out for something and they slap your hand
i remember all too well
just how it feels to be all alone
to feel like you'd give anything
for just a little place you can call your own

that's when you need someone
someone that you can call
when all your faith is gone
and it feels like you can't go on

walks through the garden rows with her bare feet, laughing
i never learned to count my blessings
i choose instead to dwell in my disasters
i walk on down the hill
through grass, grown tall and brown
and still its hard somehow to let go of my pain
on past the busted back of that
old and rusted cadillac
that sinks into this field, collecting rain
will i always feel this way?
so empty, so estranged
and of these cut throat busted sunsets
these cold and damp white mornings, i have grown weary
if through my cracked and dusted dime store lips
i spoke these words out loud would no one hear me?
lay your blouse across the chair
let fall the flowers from from your hair
and kiss me with that country mouth, so plain
outside, the rain is tapping on the leaves
to me it sounds like they're applauding us
the the quiet love we made
will i always feel this way?
so empty, so estranged
well, i looked my demons in the eyes
laid bare my chest, said "do your best, destroy me
you see, i've been to hell and back so many times
i must admit you kind of bore me."
there's a lot of things that can kill a man
there's a lot of ways to die
listen, some already did that, walked beside me
there's a lot of things i don't understand
why so many people lie
it's the hurt i hide that fuels the fire inside me
will i always feel this way?
so empty, so estranged7embedshare urlcopyembedcopywhen you came to me with your bad dreams and your fears

i could hold you in my arms, oh
i could hold you forever

when you kissed my lips with my mouth so full of questions

place your hands on my face
close my eyes and say
love is a poor man's food
with no proper side

i could hold you in my arms
i could hold you forever

weapons of war

shot down like a dog in broad daylight
was a matter of timing and the timing was right

"no reason to get excited"
the thief, he kindly spoke
"there are many here among us
who feel that life is but a joke
but you and i, we've been through that
and this is not our fate
so let us not talk falsely now
the hour is getting late"

all along the watchtower
princes kept the view
while all the women came and went
barefoot servants too
outside, in the distance
a wildcat did growl
two riders were approaching
the wind began to howlonce upon a time you dressed so fine
threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
people call, say "beware doll, you're bound to fall"
you thought they were all a kiddin' you
you used to laugh about
everybody that was hangin' out
now you don't talk so loud
now you don't seem so proud
about having to be scrounging your next meal

how does it feel?
how does it feel?
to be without a home?
like a complete unknown?
like a rolling stone?

aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, miss lonely
but ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
and now you re gonna have to get used to it
you say you never compromise
with the mystery tramp, but now you realize
he's not selling any alibis
as you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
and say,  do you want to make a deal?"

how does it feel?
how does it feel?
to be on your own
with no direction home
a complete unknown
like a rolling stone?

aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
on the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
never understood that it ain't no good
you shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
you used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
ain't it hard when you discover that
he really wasn't where it's at
after he took from you everything he could steal?

how does it feel?
how does it feel?
to hang on your own
with no direction home
like a complete unknown
like a rolling stone?

aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
they're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
exchangin' all precious gifts
but you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
you used to be so amused
at napoleon in rags and the language that he used
go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
when ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
you're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

how does it feel?
aw, how does it feel?
to be on your own
with no direction home
like a complete unknown
like a rolling stone?when the rain is blowing in your face
and the whole world is on your case
i could offer you a warm embrace
to make you feel my love

when the evening shadows and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
i could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love

i know you haven t made your mind up yet
but i would never do you wrong
i ve known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind where you belong

i d go hungry, i d go black and blue
i d go crawling down the avenue
there s nothing that i wouldn t do
to make you feel my love

the storms are raging on the rolling sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you ain't seen nothing like me yet

i could make you happy, make your dreams come true
nothing that i wouldn t do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my lovepistol shots ring out in the barroom night
enter patty valentine from the upper hall
she sees the bartender in a pool of blood
cries out,  my god, they killed them all  

here comes the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could a been
the champion of the world

three bodies lyin' there
does patty see
and another man named bello
moving around mysteriously
 i didn t do it,  he says
and he throws up his hands
 i was only robbin' the register
i hope you understand

i saw them leaving,  he says, and he stops
 one of us had better call up the cops 
and so patty calls the cops
and they arrive on the scene
with their red lights flashin'
in the hot new jersey night

meanwhile, far away in another part of town
rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
just like the time before and the time before that
in paterson that s just the way things go
if you re black
you might as well not show up on the street
unless you want to draw the heat

alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowling around
he said,  i saw two men running out
they looked like middleweights
they jumped into a white car with out of state plates 

and miss patty valentine just nodded her head
cop said,  wait a minute, boys, this one s not dead 
so they took him to the infirmary
and though this man could hardly see
they told him that he could identify the guilty men

four in the morning and they haul rubin in
they take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
the wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
says,  why did you bring him in here for?
he ain't the guy  

here s the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could a been
the champion of the world

four months later, the ghettos are in flame
rubin s in south america, fighting for his name
while arthur dexter bradley s still in the robbery game
and the cops are putting the screws to him
lookin' for somebody to blame

 remember that murder that happened in a bar? 
 remember you said you saw the getaway car? 
 you think you d like to play ball with the law? 
 think it might a been that fighter that you saw
running that night? 
 don t forget that you are white 

arthur dexter bradley said,  i m really not sure 
the cops said,  a poor boy like you could use a break
we got you for the motel job
and we re talking to your friend bello
now you don t want to have to go back to jail
be a nice fellow

you ll be doing society a favor
that sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
we want to put his ass in stir
we want to pin this triple murder
on him
he ain t no gentleman jim 

rubin could take a man out with just one punch
but he never did like to talk about it all that much
"it s my work", he d say, "and i do it for pay
and when it s over i d just as soon go on my way"

up to some paradise
where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
and ride a horse along a trail
but then they took him to the jailhouse
where they try to turn a man
into a mouse

all of rubin s cards were marked in advance
the trial was a pig circus
he never had a chance
the judge made rubin s witnesses
drunkards from the slums
to the white folks who watched
he was a revolutionary bum

and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
no one doubted that he pulled the trigger
and though they could not produce the gun
the d.a. said he was the one
who did the deed
and the all white jury agreed

rubin carter was falsely tried
the crime was murder  one, 
guess who testified?
bello and bradley and they both baldly lied
and the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

how can the life of such a man
be in the palm of some fool s hand?
to see him obviously framed
couldn t help but make me feel ashamed
to live in a land
where justice is a game

now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
are free to drink martinis
and watch the sun rise
while rubin sits like buddha
in a ten foot cell
an innocent man in a living hell

yes that s the story of the hurricane
but it won t be over till they clear his name
and give him back the time he s done
put in a prison cell, but one time he could a been
the champion of the worldwell, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
if'n you don't know by now
and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
it'll never do somehow
when your rooster crows at the break of dawn
look out your window and i'll be gone
you're the reason i'm a traveling on
but don't think twice, it's all right

and it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
the light i never knowed
and it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
i'm on the dark side of the road
but i wish there was something you would do or say
to try and make me change my mind and stay
but we never did too much talking anyway
but don't think twice, it's all right

so it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
like you never done before
and it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
i can't hear you anymore
i'm a thinking and a wondering, walking down the road
i once loved a woman, a child, i'm told
i gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
but don't think twice, it's all right

so long, honey babe
where i'm bound, i can't tell
goodbye's too good a word, babe
so i'll just say, "fare thee well"
i ain't a saying you treated me unkind
you could've done better, but i don't mind
you just kinda wasted my precious time
but don't think twice, it's all righthey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to
hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you

though i know that evening's empire has returned into sand
vanished from my hand
left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping
my weariness amazes me, i am branded on my feet
i have no one to meet
and my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to
hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you

take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
my senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
my toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
to be wandering
i'm ready to go anywhere, i'm ready for to fade
into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way
i promise to go under it

hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to
hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you

though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
it's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
and but for the sky there are no fences facing
and if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
to your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
i wouldn't pay it any mind
it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to
hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' you

and take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
the haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
with all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
let me forget about today until tomorrow

hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
i'm not sleepy and there is no place i'm going to
hey mr. tambourine man, play a song for me
in the jingle jangle mornin' i'll come followin' youoh, where have you been, my blue eyed son?
and where have you been, my darling young one?
i ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
i ve walked and i ve crawled on six crooked highways
i ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
i ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
i ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

and it s a hard, and it s a hard, it s a hard, it s a hard
it s a hard rain s a going to fall

oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?
and what did you see, my darling young one?
i saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
i saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
i saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
i saw a room full of men with their hammers a bleeding
i saw a white ladder all covered with water
i saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
i saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

and it s a hard, it s a hard, it s a hard, and it s a hard
it s a hard rain s a going to fall

and what did you hear, my blue eyed son?
and what did you hear, my darling young one?
i heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
i heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
i heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a blazing
i heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening
i heard one person starve, i heard many people laughing
i heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
i heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

and it s a hard, it s a hard, it s a hard, it s a hard
it s a hard rain s a going to fall

oh, what did you meet, my blue eyed son?
and who did you meet, my darling young one?
i met a young child beside a dead pony
i met a white man who walked a black dog
i met a young woman, her body was burning
i met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
i met one man who was wounded in love
i met another man who was wounded in hatred

and it s a hard, it s a hard, it s a hard, it s a hard
it s a hard rain s a going to fall

and what will you do now, my blue eyed son?
and what will you do now, my darling young one?
i m a going back out  fore the rain starts a falling
i ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
where the people are many and their hands are all empty
where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
and the executioner s face is always well hidden
where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
where black is the color, where none is the number
and i ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it
and reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
then i ll stand on the ocean until i start sinking
but i ll know my song well before i start singing

and it s a hard, it s a hard, it s a hard, and it s a hard
it s a hard rain s a going to falljohnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
i'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
the man in a trench coat, badge out, laid off
says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
look out kid, it's somethin' you did
god knows when, but you're doin' it again
you better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
the man in the coon skin cap in a pig pen
wants 11 dollar bills   you only got 10

maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed, but
phone's tapped anyway
maggie says the many say
they must bust in early may
orders from the d.a
look out kid, don't matter what you did
walk on your tip toes, don t tie no bows
better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail
get jailed, jump bail, join the army if you fail
look out kid, you're gonna get hit
by losers, cheaters, six time users
hanging 'round the theaters
girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
don't follow leaders, a watch the parking meters

oh, get born, keep warm
short pants, romance
learn to dance, get dressed
get blessed, try to be a success
please her, please him, buy gifts
don't steal, don't lift
20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
look out kid, they keep it all hid
better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum
the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handlesthey re selling postcards of the hanging
they re painting the passports brown
the beauty parlor is filled with sailors
the circus is in town
here comes the blind commissioner
they ve got him in a trance
one hand is tied to the tight rope walker
the other is in his pants

and the riot squad, they re restless
they need somewhere to go
as lady and i look out tonight
from desolation row

cinderella, she seems so easy
"it takes one to know one," she smiles
and puts her hands in her back pockets
bette davis style
and in comes romeo, he s moaning
 you belong to me, i believe 
and someone says,  you re in the wrong place, my friend
you'd better leave 

and the only sound that s left
after the ambulances go
is cinderella sweeping up
on desolation row

now the moon is almost hidden
the stars are beginning to hide
the fortune telling lady
has even taken all her things inside
all except for cain and abel
and the hunchback of notre dame
everybody is making love
or else expecting rain

and the good samaritan, he s dressing
he s getting ready for the show
he s going to the carnival tonight
on desolation row

ophelia, she s  neath the window
for her i feel so afraid
on her twenty second birthday
she already is an old maid
to her, death is quite romantic
she wears an iron vest
her profession s her religion
her sin is her lifelessness

and though her eyes are fixed upon
noah s great rainbow
she spends her time peeking
into desolation row

einstein, disguised as robin hood
with his memories in a trunk
passed this way an hour ago
with his friend, a jealous monk
now he looked so immaculately frightful
as he bummed a cigarette
then he went off sniffing drainpipes
and reciting the alphabet

you would not think to look at him
but he was famous long ago
for playing the electric violin
on desolation row

dr. filth, he keeps his world
inside of a leather cup
but all his sexless patients
they re trying to blow it up
now his nurse, some local loser
she s in charge of the cyanide hole
and she also keeps the cards that read
 have mercy on his soul 

they all play on the pennywhistle
you can hear them blow
if you lean your head out far enough
from desolation row

across the street they ve nailed the curtains
they re getting ready for the feast
the phantom of the opera
in a perfect image of a priest
they are spoon feeding casanova
to get him to feel more assured
then they ll kill him with self confidence
after poisoning him with words

and the phantom s shouting to skinny girls
 get outta here if you don t know
casanova is just being punished for going
to desolation row 

at midnight all the agents
and the superhuman crew
come out and round up everyone
that knows more than they do
then they bring them to the factory
where the heart attack machine
is strapped across their shoulders
and then the kerosene

is brought down from the castles
by insurance men who go
check to see that nobody is escaping
to desolation row

praise be to nero s neptune
the titanic sails at dawn
everybody s shouting
 which side are you on? 
and ezra pound and t. s. eliot
fighting in the captain s tower
while calypso singers laugh at them
and fishermen hold flowers

between the windows of the sea
where lovely mermaids flow
and nobody has to think too much
about desolation row


yes, i received your letter yesterday
about the time the doorknob broke
when you asked me how i was doing
was that some kinda joke?
all these people that you mention
yes, i know them, they re quite lame
i had to rearrange their faces
and give them all another name

right now, i can t read too good
don t send me no more letters, no
not unless you mail them
from desolation rowearly one morning the sun was shining
i was laying in bed
wondering if she'd changed at all
if her hair was still red
her folks they said our lives together
sure was going to be rough
they never did like mama's homemade dress
papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
and i was standing on the side of the road
rain falling on my shoes
heading out for the east coast
lord knows i've paid some dues
getting through
tangled up in blue

she was married when we first met
soon to be divorced
i helped her out of a jam, i guess
but i used a little too much force
we drove that car as far as we could
abandoned it out west
split up on a dark sad night
both agreeing it was best
she turned around to look at me
as i was walking away
i heard her say over my shoulder
"we'll meet again someday
on the avenue"
tangled up in blue

i had a job in the great north woods
working as a cook for a spell
but i never did like it all that much
and one day the ax just fell
so i drifted down to new orleans
where i lucky was to be employed
working for a while on a fishing boat
right outside of delacroix
but all the while i was alone
the past was close behind
i seen a lot of women
but she never escaped my mind
and i just grew
tangled up in blue

she was working in a topless place
and i stopped in for a beer
i just kept looking at the side of her face
in the spotlight, so clear
and later on, when the crowd thinned out
i was just about to do the same
she was standing there, in back of my chair
said to me "tell me, don't i know your name?"
i muttered something underneath my breath
she studied the lines on my face
i must admit, i felt a little uneasy
when she bent down to tie the laces
of my shoe
tangled up in blue

she lit a burner on the stove
and offered me a pipe
"i thought you'd never say hello" she said
"you look like the silent type"
then she opened up a book of poems
and handed it to me
written by an italian poet
from the thirteenth century
and every one of them words rang true
and glowed like burning coal
pouring off of every page
like it was written in my soul
from me to you
tangled up in blue

i lived with them on montague street
in a basement down the stairs
there was music in the cafes at night
and revolution in the air
then he started into dealing with slaves
and something inside of him died
she had to sell everything she owned
and froze up inside
and when it finally, the bottom fell out
i became withdrawn
the only thing i knew how to do
was to keep on keeping on
like a bird that flew
tangled up in blue

so now i'm going back again
i got to get to her somehow
all the people we used to know
they're an illusion to me now
some are mathematicians
some are carpenter's wives
don't know how it all got started
i don't know what they're doing with their lives
but me, i'm still on the road
a heading for another joint
we always did feel the same
we just saw it from a different point
of view
tangled up in bluecome, you masters of war
you that build the big guns
you that build the death planes
you that build all the bombs
you that hide behind walls
you that hide behind desks
i just want you to know
i can see through your masks

you that never done nothing
but build to destroy
you play with my world
like it's your little toy
you put a gun in my hand
and you hide from my eyes
and you turn and run farther
when the fast bullets fly

like judas of old
you lie and deceive
a world war can be won
you want me to believe
but i see through your eyes
and i see through your brain
like i see through the water
that runs down my drain

you fasten all the triggers
for the others to fire
then you set back and watch
while the death count gets higher
you hide in your mansion
while the young people's blood
flows out of their bodies
and is buried in the mud

you've thrown the worst fear
that can ever be hurled
fear to bring children
into the world
for threatening my baby
unborn and unnamed
you ain't worth the blood
that runs in your veins

how much do i know
to talk out of turn?
you might say that i'm young
you might say i'm unlearned
but there's one thing i know
though i'm younger than you
that even jesus would never
forgive what you do

let me ask you one question
is your money that good?
will it buy you forgiveness?
do you think that it could?
i think you will find
when your death takes its toll
all the money you made
will never buy back your soul

and i hope that you die
and your death will come soon
i will follow your casket
by the pale afternoon
and i'll watch while you're lowered
down to your deathbed
and i'll stand over your grave
'til i'm sure that you're deadooh, ooh
ooh, ooh

mama, take this badge off of me
i can t use it anymore
it s getting dark, too dark to see
i feel i m knockin' upon heaven s door

knock, knock, knockin' on heaven s door
knock, knock, knockin' on heaven s door
knock, knock, knockin' on heaven s door
knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

mama, put my guns in the ground
i can t shoot them anymore
that long black cloud is coming down
i feel i m knockin' on heaven s door

knock, knock, knockin' on heaven s door
knock, knock, knockin' on heaven s door
knock, knock, knockin' on heaven s door
knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

ooh, ooh
ooh, oohdarkness at the break of noon
shadows even the silver spoon
the handmade blade, the child's balloon
eclipses both the sun and moon
to understand you know too soon
there is no sense in trying

pointed threats they bluff with scorn
suicide remarks are torn
from the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
plays wasted words, proves to warn
that he not busy being born
is busy dying

temptation's page flies out the door
you follow, find yourself at war
watch waterfalls of pity roar
you feel to moan, but unlike before
you discover that you'd just be one more
person crying

so don't fear if you hear
a foreign sound to your ear
it's alright, ma, i'm only sighing

as some warn victory, some downfall
private reasons, great or small
can be seen in the eyes of those that call
to make all that should be killed to crawl
while others say don't hate nothing at all
except hatred

disillusioned words like bullets bark
as human gods aim for their mark
make everything from toy guns that spark
to flesh colored christs that glow in the dark
it's easy to see without lookin' too far
that not much is really sacred

while preachers preach of evil fates
teachers teach that knowledge waits
can lead to hundred dollar plates
goodness hides behind its gates
but even the president of the united states
sometimes must have to stand naked

and though the rules of the road have been lodged
it's only people's games that you got to dodge
and it's alright, ma, i can make it

advertising signs that con
you into thinking you're the one
that can do what's never been done
that can win what's never been won
meantime, life outside goes on
all around you

you lose yourself, you reappear
you suddenly find you got nothing to fear
alone you stand with nobody near
when a trembling distant voice, unclear
startles your sleeping ears to hear
that somebody thinks they really found you

a question in your nerves is lit
yet you know there is no answer fit
to satisfy, ensure you not to quit
to keep it in your mind and not forget
that it is not he, or she, or them, or it
that you belong to

but though the masters make the rules
for the wise men and the fools
i got nothing, ma, to live up to

for them that must obey authority
that they do not respect in any degree
who despise their jobs, their destiny
speak jealously of them that are free
do what they do just to be
nothing more than something they invest in

while some on principles baptized
to strict party platform ties
social clubs in drag disguise
outsiders they can freely criticize
tell nothing except who to idolize
and say "god bless him"

while one who sings with his tongue on fire
gargles in the rat race choir
bent out of shape from society's pliers
cares not to come up any higher
but rather get you down in the hole
that he's in

but i mean no harm, nor put fault
on anyone that lives in a vault
but it's alright, ma, if i can't please him

old lady judges watch people in pairs
limited in sex, they dare
to push fake morals, insult and stare
while money doesn't talk, it swears
obscenity, who really cares
propaganda, all is phony

while them that defend what they cannot see
with a killer's pride, security
it blows the minds most bitterly
for them that think death's honesty
won't fall upon 'em naturally
life sometimes must get lonely

my eyes collide head on with stuffed
graveyards, false goals, i scuff
at pettiness which plays so rough
walk upside down inside handcuffs
kick my legs to crash it off
say, okay, i've had enough
what else can you show me?

and if my thought dreams could be seen
they'd probably put my head in a guillotine
but it's alright, ma, it's life, and life onlyif you re travelin' in the north country fair
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
remember me to one who lives there
for she once was a true love of mine

if you go when the snowflakes storm
when the rivers freeze and summer ends
please see if she has a coat so warm
to keep her from the howling winds

please see if her hair hangs long
if it rolls and flows all down her breast
please see for me if her hair's hangin' long
for that s the way i remember her best

i m a wondering if she remembers me at all
many times i ve often prayed
in the darkness of my night
in the brightness of my day

so if you re travelin' the north country fair
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
remember me to one who lives there
for she once was a true love of minethe pale moon rose in its glory
out o'er the western town
she told a sad, sad story
of the great ship that went down

t'was the fourteenth day of april
over the waves she rode
sailing into tomorrow
to a gilded age foretold

the night was black with starlight
the seas were sharp and clear
moving through the shadows
the promised hour was near

lights were holding steady
gliding over the foam
all the lords and ladies
heading for their eternal home

the chandeliers were swaying
from the balustrades above
the orchestra was playing
songs of faded love

the watchman, he lay dreaming
as the ballroom dancers twirled
he dreamed the titanic was sinking
into the underworld

leo took his sketchbook
he was often so inclined
he closed his eyes and painted
the scenery in his mind

cupid struck his bosom
and broke it with a snap
the closest woman to him
he fell into her lap

he heard a loud commotion
something sounded wrong
his inner spirit was saying
that he couldn't stand here long

he staggered to the quarterdeck
no time now to sleep
water on the quarterdeck
already three foot deep

smokestack was leaning sideways
heavy feet began to pound
he walked into the whirlwind
sky splitting all around

the ship was going under
the universe had opened wide
the roll was called up yonder
the angels turned aside

lights down in the hallway
flickering dim and dull
dead bodies already floating
in the double bottom hull

the engines then exploded
propellers they failed to start
the boilers overloaded
the ship's bow split apart

passengers were flying
backward, forward, far and fast
they mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
each one more weary than the last

the veil was torn asunder
'tween the hours of twelve and one
no change, no sudden wonder
could undo what had been done

the watchman lay there dreaming
at forty five degrees
he dreamed that the titanic was sinking
dropping to her knees

wellington he was sleeping
his bed began to slide
his valiant heart was beating
he pushed the tables aside

glass of shattered crystal
lay scattered roundabout
he strapped on both his pistols
how long could he hold out?

his men and his companions
were nowhere to be seen
in silence there he waited for
time and space to intervene

the passageway was narrow
there was blackness in the air
he saw every kind of sorrow
heard voices everywhere

alarm bells were ringing
to hold back the swelling tide
friends and lovers clinging
to each other side by side

mothers and their daughters
descending down the stairs
jumped into the icy waters
love and pity sent their prayers

the rich man, mister astor
kissed his darling wife
he had no way of knowing
be the last trip of his life

calvin, blake, and wilson
gambled in the dark
not one of them would ever live to
tell the tale or disembark

brother rose up 'gainst brother
in every circumstance
they fought and slaughtered each other
in a deadly dance

they lowered down the lifeboats
from the sinking wreck
there were traitors, there were turncoats
broken backs and broken necks

the bishop left his cabin
to help all those in need
turned his eyes up to the heavens
said, "the poor are yours to feed"

davey the brothel keeper
came out dismissed his girls
saw the water getting deeper
saw the changing of his world

jim backus smiled
he never learned to swim
saw the little crippled child
and he gave his seat to him

he saw the starlight shining
streaming from the east
death was on the rampage
but his heart was now at peace

they battened down the hatches
but the hatches wouldn't hold
they drowned upon the staircase
of brass and polished gold

leo said to cleo
i think i'm going mad
but he'd lost his mind already
whatever mind he had

he tried to block the doorway
to save all those from harm
blood from an open wound
pouring down his arm

petals fell from flowers
tell all of them were gone
in the long and dreadful hours
the wizard's curse played on

the host was pouring brandy
he was going down slow
he stayed right to the end and he
was the last to go

there were many, many others
nameless here forever more
they never sailed the ocean
or left their homes before

the watchman, he lay dreaming
the damage had been done
he dreamed the titanic was sinking
and he tried to tell someone

the captain, barely breathing
kneeling at the wheel
above him and beneath him
fifty thousand tons of steel

he looked over at his compass
and he gazed into its face
needle pointing downward
he knew he lost the race

in the dark illumination
he remembered bygone years
he read the book of revelation
and he filled his cup with tears

when the reaper's task had ended
sixteen hundred had gone to rest
the good, the bad, the rich, the poor
the loveliest and the best

they waited at the landing
and they tried to understand
but there is no understanding
for the judgment of god's hand

the news came over the wires
and struck with deadly force
the love had lost its fires
all things had run their course

the watchman he lay dreaming
of all the things that can be
he dreamed the titanic was sinking
into the deep blue seayou must leave now
take what you need, you think will last
but whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
yonder stands your orphan with his gun
crying like a fire in the sun

look out, the saints are coming through
and it's all over now, baby blue

the highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
take what you have gathered from coincidence
the empty handed painter from your streets
is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

the sky, too, is folding under you
and it's all over now, baby blue

all your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
all your reindeer armies are all going home
your lover who just walked out the door
has taken all his blankets from the floor

the carpet, too, is moving under you
and it's all over now, baby blue

leave your stepping stones behind
there's something that calls for you
forget the dead you've left
they will not follow you
the vagabond who's rapping at your door
is standing in the clothes that you once wore

strike another match, go start anew
and it's all over now, baby blueyou walk into the room
with your pencil in your hand
you see somebody naked
and you, you say, "who is that man?"
you try so hard
but you don't understand
just what you will say
when you get home

because something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?

you raise up your head
and you ask, "is this where it is?"
and somebody points to you and says
"it's his"
and you say, "what's mine?"
and somebody else says, "well, what is?"
and you say, "oh my god, am i here all alone?"

but something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?

you hand in your ticket
and you go watch the geek
who immediately walks up to you
when he hears you speak
and says, "how does it feel to
be such a freak?"
and you say, "impossible"
as he hands you a bone

and something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?

you have many contacts
among the lumberjacks
to get you facts
when someone attacks your imagination
but nobody has any respect
anyway they already expect you
to all give a check
to tax deductible charity organization
aw, you've been with the professors
and they've all liked your looks
with great lawyers you have
discussed lepers and crooks
you've been through all of
f. scott fitzgerald's books
you are very well read
it's well known

but something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?

well the sword swallower, he comes up to you
and then he kneels
he crosses himself
and then he clicks his high heels
and without further notice
he asks you how it feels
and he says, "here is your throat back
thanks for the loan"

and something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?

now you see this one eyed midget
shouting the word "now"
and you say, "for what reason?"
and he says, "how?"
and you say, "what does this mean?"
and he screams back "you're a cow
give me some milk or else go home"

and you know something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?

well, you walk into the room
like a camel and then you frown
you put your eyes in your pocket
and your nose on the ground
there oughtta be a law
against you comin' around
you should be made
to wear earphones

'cause something is happening here
but ya' don't know what it is
do you, mister jones?almost heaven, west virginia

comin  home to a place he d never been before
he left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
you might say he found a key for every door
when he first came to the mountains his life was far away
on the road and hangin  by a song
but the string s already broken and he doesn t really care
it keeps changin  fast and it don t last for long

but the colorado rocky mountain high
i ve seen it rainin  fire in the sky
the shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
rocky mountain high  in colorado 
rocky mountain high  in colorado 

he climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
he saw everything as far as you can see
and they say he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
and he lost a friend but kept the memory
now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
seeking grace in every step he takes
his sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
the serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

and the colorado rocky mountain high
i ve seen it rainin  fire in the sky
talk to god and listen to the casual reply
rocky mountain high  in colorado 
rocky mountain high  in colorado 

now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
of the simple thing he cannot comprehend
why they try to tear the mountains down
to bring in a couple more
more people, more scars upon the land

and the colorado rocky mountain high
i ve seen it rainin  fire in the sky
though he'd be a poorer man if he never saw eagles fly

where the deer and the antelope play
where seldom is heard a discouraging word
and the skies are not cloudy all day
home, home on the range
where the deer and the antelope play
where seldom is heard a discouraging word
and the skies are not cloudy all day
the red man was pressed from this part of the west
it's not likely he'll ever return
to the banks of red river where seldom if ever
his flickering campfires still burn
home, home on the range
where the deer and the antelope play
where seldom is heard a discouraging word
and the skies are not cloudy all day
how often at night when the heavens are bright
i see the light of those flickering stars
have i laid there amazed and asked as i gazed
if their glory exceeds that of love

where the deer and the antelope play
where seldom is heard a discouraging word
and the skies are not cloudy all daywell, life on a farm is kinda laid back

when the sun's coming up, i got cakes on the griddle
and life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
thank god i'm a country boy


well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
and he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
said, "live a good life, play my fiddle with pride
thank god you're a country boy."
my daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
he taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
he taught me how to love and how to give just a little
and thank god i'm a country boy

well, i got me a fine wife, i got me old fiddle
when the sun's coming up, i got cakes on the griddle
life ain't nothing but a funny, funny riddle
whoo, thank god i'm a country boy, yes sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
sunshine on the water looks so lovely
sunshine almost always makes me high
if i had a day that i could give you
i'd give to you the day just like today
if i had a song that i could sing for you
i'd sing a song to make you feel this way
sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
sunshine on the water looks so lovely
sunshine almost always makes me high
if i had a tale that i could tell you
i'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
if i had a wish that i could wish for you
i'd make a wish for sunshine for all the while
sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
sunshine on the water looks so lovely
sunshine almost always makes me high
sunshine almost all the time makes me high
sunshine almost alwayslady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me
did you think our time together was all gone
lady, you've been dreaming, i'm as close as i can be
and i swear to you our time has just begun
close your eyes and rest your weary mind
i promise i will stay right here beside you
today our lives were joined, became entwined
i wish that you could know how much i love you
lady, are you happy, do you feel the way i do
are there meanings that you've never seen before
lady, my sweet lady, i just can't believe it's true
and it's like i've never, ever loved before
lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me
did you think our time together was all gone
lady, my sweet lady, i'm as close as i can be
and i swear to you our time has just begunperhaps love is like a resting place, a shelter from the storm
it exists to give you comfort, it is there to keep you warm
and in those times of trouble when you are most alone
the memory of love will bring you home
perhaps love is like a window, perhaps an open door
it invites you to come closer, it wants to show you more
and even if you lose yourself and don't know what to do
the memory of love will see you through
love to some is like a cloud, to some as strong as steel
for some a way of living, for some a way to feel
and some say love is holding on and some say letting go
and some say love is everything, and some say they don't know
perhaps love is like the ocean, full of conflict, full of pain
like a fire when it's cold outside, thunder when it rains
if i should live forever, and all my dreams come true
my memories of love will be of you
love to some is like a cloud, to some as strong as steel
for some a way of living, for some a way to feel
and some say love is holding on and some say letting go
and some say love is everything, and some say they don't knowit's by far the hardest thing i've ever done
to be so in love with you and so alone
follow me where i go, what i do, who i know
make it part of you to be a part of me
follow me up and down
all the way and all around
take my hand and say you'll follow me
it's long been on my mind
you know it's been a long, long time
i've tried to find the way that i can make you understand
the way i feel about you
and just how much i need you
to be there where i can talk to you
when there's no one else around
follow me where i go, what i do, who i know
make it part of you to be a part of me
follow me up and down
all the way and all around
take my hand and say you'll follow me
you see i'd like to share my life with you
and show you things i've seen
places that i'm going to
places where i've been
to have you there beside me
to never be alone
and all the time that you're with me
we will be at home
follow me where i go, what i do, who i know
make it part of you to be a part of me
follow me up and down
all the way...
take my hand and i will follow youi guess he'd rather be in colorado
he'd rather spend his time out where the sky looks like a pearl after a rain
once again i see him walkin once again i hear him talking to the stars he makes
and asking them for bus fare
i guess he'd rather be in colorado
he'd rather play his banjo in the morning when the moon is scarcely gone
in the dawn the subways comin in the dawn i hear him hummin'
some old song he wrote of love in boulder canyon
i guess he'd rather be in colorado
i guess he'd rather be in colorado
i guess he'd rather work out where the only thing you earn is what you spend
in the end up in his office
in the end a quiet cough is all he has to show
he lives in new york cityto sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean
to ride on the crest of the wild raging storm
to work in the service of life and the living
in search of the answers to questions unknown
to be part of the movement and part of the growing
part of beginning to understand

aye, calypso, the place's you've been to
the things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
aye, calypso, i sing to your spirit
the men who have served you so long and so well

like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you
to light up the darkness and show us the way
for though we are strangers in your silent world
to live on the land we must learn from the sea
to be true as the tide and free as a wind swell
joyful and loving in letting it be

aye, calypso, the place's you've been to
the things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
aye, calypso, i sing to your spirit
the men who have served you so long and so well
aye, calypso, the place's you've been to
the things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
aye, calypso, i sing to your spirit
the men who have served you so long and so wellit's cold here in the city
it always seems that way
and i've been thinking
about you almost everyday
thinking about the good times
thinking about the rain
thinking about how bad it feels alone again

i'm sorry
for the way things are in china
i'm sorry
things ain't what they used to be
but more than anything else
i'm sorry for myself
'cause you're not here with me

our friends all ask about you
i say you're doing fine
and i expect to hear
from you almost anytime
but they all know i'm crying
and i can't sleep at night
they all know i'm dying down deep inside



i'm sorry
if i took some things for granted
i'm sorry
for the chains i put on you
but more than anything else
i'm sorry for myself
for living without you
it's cold here in the city
it always seems that way
and i've been thinking about you almost every dayi've been lately thinking
about my life's time
all the things i've done
and how it's been
and i can't help believing
in my own mind
i know i'm gonna hate to see it end

i've seen a lot of sunshine
slept out in the rain
spent a night or two all on my own
i've known my lady's pleasures
had myself some friends
and spent a time or two in my own home

and i have to say it now
it's been a good life all in all
it's really fine
to have a chance to hang around
and lie there by the fire
and watch the evening tire
while all my friends and my old lady
sit and pass the pipe around

and talk of poems and prayers and promises
and things that we believe in
how sweet it is to love someone
how right it is to care
how long it's been since yesterday
and what about tomorrow
and what about our dreams
and all the memories we share

the days they pass so quickly now
nights are seldom long
and time around me whispers when it's cold
the changes somehow frighten me
still i have to smile
it turns me on to think of growing old

for though my life's been good to me
there's still so much to do
so many things my mind has never known
i'd like to raise a family
i'd like to sail away
and dance across the mountains on the moon

i have to say it now
it's been a good life all in all
it's really fine
to have the chance to hang around
and lie there by the fire
and watch the evening tire
while all my friends and my old lady
sit and pass the pipe around

and talk of poems and prayers and promises
and things that we believe in
how sweet it is to love someone
how right it is to care
how long it's been since yesterday
what about tomorrow
what about our dreams
and all the memories we sharetoday, while the blossoms still cling to the vine
i'll taste your strawberries, i'll drink your sweet wine
a million tomorrows shall all pass away
'ere i forget all the joy that is mine, today
i'll be a dandy, and i'll be a rover
you'll know who i am by the songs that i sing
i'll feast at your table, i'll sleep in your clover
who cares what the morrow shall bring
today, while the blossoms still cling to the vine
i'll taste your strawberries, i'll drink your sweet wine
a million tomorrows shall all pass away
 ere i forget all the joy that is mine, today
i can't be contented with yesterday's glory
i can't live on promises winter to spring
today is my moment, now is my story
i'll laugh and i'll cry and i'll sing
today, while the blossoms still cling to the vine
i'll taste your strawberries, i'll drink your sweet wine
a million tomorrows shall all pass away
'ere i forget all the joy that is mine, today
today, while the blossoms still cling to the vine
i'll taste your strawberries, i'll drink your sweet wine
a million tomorrows shall all pass away
'ere i forget all the joy that is mine, todaythere's a storm across the valley
clouds are rolling in
the afternoon is heavy
on your shoulders
there's a truck out on the four lane
a mile or more away
and the whining of his wheels
just makes it colder

he's an hour away from riding
on your prayers up in the sky
and ten days on the road
are barely gone
there's a fire softly burning
supper's on the stove
it's the light in your eyes
that makes him warm

hey, it's good to be back home again
sometimes this old farm
feels like a long lost friend
yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

there's all the news to tell him
how'd you spend your time
what's the latest thing the neighbors say
and your mother called last friday
sunshine made her cry
you felt the baby move just yesterday

hey, it's good to be back home again, yes it is
sometimes this old farm
feels like a long lost friend
yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

and all the time that i can lay this tired, old body down
to feel your fingers feather soft upon me
the kisses that i live for
the love that lights my way
the happiness that living with you brings me

it's the sweetest thing i know of
just spending time with you
it's the little things that make a house a home
like a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove
the light in your eyes that makes me warm

hey, it's good to be back home again
sometimes this old farm
feels like a long lost friend
yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again
hey, it's good to be back home again, oh it is
sometimes this old farm
feels like a long lost friend
hey, it's good to be back home again
i said hey, it's good to be back home againi've been working on the railroad
all the live long day
i've been working on the railroad
just to pass the time away
can't you hear the whistle blowing
rise up so early in the morn
can't you hear the whistle blowing
dinah, blow your horn
dinah won't you blow
dinah won't you blow
dinah, won't you blow your horn
dinah, won't you blow
dinah, won't you blow
dinah, won't you blow your horn

strumming on the old banjo
fee fie fiddle eell o
fee fie fiddle eell o
fee fie fiddle eell o
strumming on the old banjocasey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
the stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors
of silent desperation never speaking to a soul
the poison air he's breathing has a dirty smell of dying
cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
but casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
of the clicking of the turnstyle and the rattle of his chain
oh she said, casey it's been so long since i've seen you
here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile
see she said, i put on new stockings just to please you
lord she said, casey can you only stay a while
casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown
for something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
who reach for anything thay can to keep from going home
standing in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
never glancing in the mirror at the people passin' by
and he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason
is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
oh she said, i suppose you seldom think about me
now she said, now that you've a family of your own
still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body
lord she said, casey it's a shame to be alone
oh she said, casey it's been so long since i've seen you
here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile
see she said, i put on new stockings just to please you
lord she said, casey can you only stay a while
lord she said, casey it's a shame to be alonei'll walk in the rain by your side
i'll cling to the warmth of your hand
i'll do anything to keep you satisfied
and i'll love you more than anybody can
and the wind will whisper your name to me
little birds will sing along in time
leaves will bow down when you walk by
and morning bells will chime
i'll be there when you're feeling down
to kiss away the tears if you cry
i'll share with you all the happiness i've found
a reflection of the love in your eyes
and i'll sing you the songs of the rainbow
a picture of the joy that is mine
the leaves will bow down when you walk by
and morning bells will chime
i'll walk in the rain by your side
i'll cling to the warmth of your tiny hand
i'll do anything to help you understand
and i'll love you more than anybody can
and the wind will whisper your name to me
little birds will sing along in time
the leaves will bow down when you walk by
and morning bells will chimewhen i was a little bitty boy
just up off the floor
we used to go down to grandma's house
ev'ry month end or so
we'd have chicken pie and country ham
and homemade butter on the bread
but the best darn thing about grandma's house
was a great big feather bed
it was nine feet high and six feet wide
soft as a downy chick
it was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
it'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
and a piggy we stole from the shed
we didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
on grandma's feather bed
after supper we'd sit around the fire
the old folks'd spit and chew
pa would talk about the farm and the war
and granny'd sing a ballad or two
i'd sit and listen and watch the fire
'till the cobwebs filled my head
next thing i'd know i'd wake up in the morning
in the middle of the old feather bed
it was nine feet high and six feet wide
soft as a downy chick
it was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
it'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
and a piggy we stole from the shed
we didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
on grandma's feather bed
well i love my ma, i love my pa
i love granny and grandpa too
i've been fishin' with my uncle, i wrestled with my cousin
i even kissed aunt lou, eww 
but if i ever had to make a choice
i guess it ought to be said
that i'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road
for grandma's feather bed
i'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road
 well i guess... mumbling 'bout the gal down the road 
it was nine feet high and six feet wide
soft as a downy chick
it was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
it'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
and a piggy we stole from the shed
we didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
on grandma's feather bed
we didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
on grandma's feather bedso you speak to me of sadness and the coming of the winter
fear that is within you now that seems to never end
and the dreams that have escaped you
and the hope that you've forgotten
and you tell me that you need me now
and you want to be my friend
and you wonder where we're going
where's the rhyme and where's the reason?
and it's you cannot accept it is here we must begin
to seek the wisdom of the children
and the graceful way of flowers in the wind
for the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers
their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day
like the music of the mountains and the colors of the rainbow
they're a promise of the future and a blessing for today
though the cities start to crumble and the towers fall around us
the sun is slowly fading and it's colder than the sea
it is written: "from the desert to the mountains they shall lead us
by the hand and by the heart, and they will comfort you and me
in their innocence and trusting, they will teach us to be free."
for the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers
their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day
and the song that i am singing is a prayer to nonbelievers:
"come and stand beside us, we can find a better way."ain't nothin' in the world that i like better
than bacon an' lettuce n' homegrown tomatoes
up in the mornin', an' out in the garden
get you a ripe one, don't get a hard 'un
plant 'em in the spring, you eat 'em in the summer
all winter without 'em's a culinary bummer
i forgot all about the sweatin' and the diggin'
every time i go out and pick me a big'un

homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
what'd life be without homegrown tomatoes?
only two things that money can't buy
and that's true love and homegrown tomatoes

well, you can go out a'eat, that's for sure
but there's nothin' that a homegrown tomato won't cure
put 'em in a salad, put 'em in a stew
you can make your own, very own tomato juice
you can eat 'em with eggs, can eat 'em with gravy
you can eat 'em with beans, pinto or navy
put 'em on the side, put 'em in the middle
homegrown tomato on a hot cake griddle

homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
what'd life be without homegrown tomatoes?
only two things that money can't buy
and that's true love and homegrown tomatoes

if i's to change this life i lead
you could call me johnny tomatoseed
'cause i know what this country needs
homegrown tomatoes'n every yard you see
when i die, don't bury me
in a box in a cold, dark cemetery
out in the garden would be much better
'cause i could be a pushin' up a homegrown tomatoes

homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
what'd life be without homegrown tomatoes?
there's only two things that money can't buy
and that's true love and homegrown tomatoes
homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
what'd life be without homegrown tomatoes?
there's only two things that money can't buy
and that's true love and homegrown tomatoeshe was born in the bitteroot valley in the early morning rain
wild geese over the water, heading north and home again
bringin' a warm wind from the south, bringin' the first taste of the spring
his mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing:
oh, montana, give this child a home
give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild montana skies
his mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
he never knew his father and he never did ask why
he never knew the answers that would make an easy way
but he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way
his mother's brother took him in to his family and his home
gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
and he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
and he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand
oh, montana, give this child a home
give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild montana skies
on the eve of his 21st birthday, he set out on his own
he was 30 years and runnin' when he found his way back home
ridin' a storm across the mountains and an achin' in his heart
said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start
now he never told the story of the time that he was gone
some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a john
there was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
there was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave
oh, montana, give this child a home
give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild montana skies
now some say he was crazy and some are glad he's gone
but some of us will miss him and we'll try to carry on
giving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn
giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on
oh, montana, give this child a home
give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild montana skies
oh, montana, give this child a home
give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild montana skiesi came here from the city
a thousand miles away
i came just for a little while
you know i never meant to stay
i meant to take my pleasure
have a good time and be gone
but i fell in love with a lady
now i sing a mountain song
i listened to the music
of the night wind in the pines
i saw the quiet slendour
of a field of columbine
i skied on crystal pathways
to a mountain peak so tall
and i walked the mighty summits
with the one who made it all
and i fell in love with a lady
'cause i've seen her at her best
and i've walked her wild and rugged paths
through her open wilderness
and now i never can betray her
steal her riches and be gone
'cause when you love a mountain lady
you're gonna sing a mountain song
now people come from everywhere
to see what they can find
and some take lots of pictures
and some just take their time
but they're some who take her beauty
that can't be bought or sold
and they think of only money
while destroying wealth untold
but you fall in love with a lady
when you've slept upon her breast
and i've walked her wild and rugged paths
to her open wilderness
and you never can betray her
steal her riches and be gone
'cause when you love a mountain lady
you're gonna sing a mountain songthis old guitar taught me to sing a love song
showed me how to laugh and how to cry
it introduced me to some friends of mine
and brightened up some days
it helped me make it through some lonely nights
oh, what a friend to have on a cold lonely night

this old guitar gave me my lovely lady
it opened up her eyes and ears to me
it brought us close together
i guess it broke her heart
but it opened up the space for us to be
what a lovely place, a lovely space to be

this old guitar gave me my life, my living
all the things you know i love to do
to serenade the stars that shine
from a sunny mountain side
most of all, to sing my songs for you
ooh, i love to sing my songs for you
yes i do, lord, i love to sing my songs for youjosie works the counter at the downtown five and dime
anything at all to help her pass the time
her mama keeps the baby and grandpa rambles on
about the good times playing in his mind

it's a hard life livin' when you're lonely
it's a long night sleepin' alone
it's a hard time waitin' for tomorrow
it's a long, long way home

josie spends the evening with the people on the pages
of the paperback she picked up at the store
or sometimes it's the tv or she'll try to write a letter, whoa
they don't come too often anymore

it's a hard life livin' when you're lonely
it's a long night sleepin' alone
it's a hard time waitin' for tomorrow
it's a long, long way home

i stare at the gray walls before me
and i see her face in the stone
i try to imagine our baby
i wish they would let me go home
i wish they would let me go home
i wish they would let me go home

it's a hard life livin' when you're lonely
 i wish they would let me go home 
it's a long night sleepin' alone
 i wish they would let me go home 
it's a hard time waitin' for tomorrow
 i wish they would let me go home 
it's a long, long way home
 i wish they would let me go home 
it's a long, long way home
 i wish they would let me go home 
bring me and the other boys home
 i wish they would let me go home 
bring me and the other boys homei had an uncle name of matthew
he was his father's only boy
born just south of colby, kansas
he was his mother's pride and joy
yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
love was just a way to live and die
gold was just a windy kansas wheatfield
blue was just a kansas summer sky
all the stories that he told me
back when i was just a lad
all the memories that he gave me
all the good times that he had
growin' up a kansas farmboy
life was mostly havin' fun
ridin' on his daddy's shoulders
behind a mule beneath the sun
yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
love was just a way to live and die
gold was just a windy kansas wheatfield
blue was just a kansas summer sky
well, i guess there were some hard times
and i'm told some years were lean
they had a storm in forty seven
a twister came and stripped 'em clean
he lost the farm and lost his family
he lost the wheat and lost his home
but he found the family bible
a faith as solid as a stone
yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
love was just a way to live and die
gold was just a windy kansas wheatfield
blue was just a kansas summer sky
and so he came to live at our house
and he came to work the land
he came to ease my daddy's burden
and he came to be my friend
and so i wrote this down for matthew
and it's for him this song is sung
ridin' on his daddy's shoulders
behind a mule beneath the sun
yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
love was just a way to live and die
gold was just a windy kansas wheatfield
blue was just a kansas summer sky
yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
love was just a way to live and die
gold was just a windy kansas wheatfield
blue was just a kansas summer sky the wind is the whisper of our mother the earth
the wind is the hand of our father the sky
the wind watches over our struggles and pleasures
the wind is the goddess who first learned to fly
the wind is the bearer of bad and good tidings
weaver of darkness, bringer of dawn
the wind gives the rain  yes , and builds us a rainbow
the wind is the singer who sang the first song
the wind is a twister of anger and warning
the wind brings the fragrence of freshly mown hay
the wind is the racer and the white stallion running
and the sweet taste of love on a slow summer's day
the wind knows the songs of cities and canyons
thunder of mountains, the roar of the sea
the wind is the taker and giver of mornings
the wind is the symbol of all that is free
so welcome the wind and the wisdom she offers
follow her summons when she calls again
in your heart and your spirit let the breezes surround you
lift up your voice then and sing with the windon the road of experience
i'm trying to find my own way
sometimes i wish that i could fly away
when i think that i'm moving
suddenly things stand still
i'm afraid 'cause i think they always will

and i'm looking for space
and to find out who i am
and i'm looking to know and understand
it's a sweet, sweet dream
sometimes i'm almost there
sometimes i fly like an eagle
and sometimes i'm deep in despair

all alone in the universe
sometimes that's how it seems
i get lost in the sadness and the screams
then i look in the center
suddenly everything's clear
i find myself in the sunshine and my dreams

and i'm looking for space
and to find out who i am
and i'm looking to know and understand
it's a sweet, sweet dream
sometimes i'm almost there
sometimes i fly like an eagle
and sometimes i'm deep in despair

on the road of experience
join in the living day
if there's an answer
it's just that it's just that way

when you're looking for space
and to find out who you are
when you're looking to try and reach the stars
it's a sweet, sweet, sweet dream
sometimes i'm almost there
sometimes i fly like an eagle
and sometimes i'm deep in despair

sometimes i fly like an eagle
like an eagle
i go flying highfly me to the moon
let me play among the stars
and let me see what spring is like
on a jupiter and mars
in other words, hold my hand
in other words, baby, kiss me

fill my heart with song
and let me sing forevermore
you are all i long for
all i worship and adore
in other words, please be true
in other words, i love you


fill my heart with song
let me sing forevermore
you are all i long for
all i worship and adore
in other words, please be true
in other words, in other words
i love youand now, the end is near
and so i face the final curtain
my friend, i'll say it clear
i'll state my case, of which i'm certain
i've lived a life that's full
i traveled each and every highway
and more, much more than this
i did it my way

regrets, i've had a few
but then again, too few to mention
i did what i had to do
and saw it through without exemption
i planned each charted course
each careful step along the byway
and more, much more than this
i did it my way

yes, there were times, i'm sure you knew
when i bit off more than i could chew
but through it all, when there was doubt
i ate it up and spit it out
i faced it all, and i stood tall
and did it my way

i've loved, i've laughed and cried
i've had my fill, my share of losing
and now, as tears subside
i find it all so amusing
to think i did all that
and may i say, not in a shy way
oh, no, oh, no, not me
i did it my way

for what is a man, what has he got?
if not himself, then he has naught
to say the things he truly feels
and not the words of one who kneels
the record shows i took the blows
and did it my way

yes, it was my waythat's life  that's life , that's what all the people say
you're riding high in april, shot down in may
but i know i'm gonna change that tune
when i'm back on top, back on top in june
i said, that's life  that's life , and as funny as it may seem
some people get their kicks, stompin' on a dream
but i don't let it, let it get me down
'cause this fine old world it keeps spinning around

i've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
i've been up and down and over and out, and i know one thing
each time i find myself flat on my face
i pick myself up and get back in the race

that's life  that's life , i tell ya, i can't deny it
i thought of quitting, baby
but my heart just ain't gonna buy it
and if i didn't think it was worth one single try
i'd jump right on a big bird and then i'd fly

i've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
i've been up and down and over and out, and i know one thing
each time i find myself laying flat on my face
i just pick myself up and get back in the race

that's life  that's life , that's life and i can't deny it
many times i thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it
but if there's nothing shaking come this here july
i'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
my, mystart spreading the news, i'm leaving today
i want to be a part of it: new york, new york
these vagabond shoes, are longing to stray
right through the very heart of it: new york, new york

i wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
and find i'm king of the hill, top of the heap

these little town blues, are melting away
i'll make a brand new start of it in old new york

if i can make it there, i'll make it anywhere
it's up to you, new york, new york

new york, new york
i want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
and find i'm a number one, top of the list
king of the hill, a number one

these little town blues, oh, are melting away
i'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old new york
and if i can make it there, i'm gonna make it anywhere
it's up to you, new york, new yorktall and tan and young and lovely
the girl from ipanema goes walking
and when she passes
each one she passes goes "ah"

when she walks, she's like a samba
that swings so cool and sways so gentle
that when she passes, each one she passes goes  "ooh"

but i watch her so sadly
how can i tell her i love her
yes, i would give my heart gladly
but each day, when she walks to the sea
she looks straight ahead, not at me

tall,  and  tan,  and  young,  and  lovely, the girl from ipanema goes walking
and when she passes, i smile but she doesn't see
 doesn't see 

olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de gra a
ela menina que vem e que passa
num doce balan o a caminho do mar

mo a do corpo dourado do sol de ipanema
o seu balan ado mais que um poema
a coisa mais linda que eu j vi passar..

ooh, but i watch her so sadly

ah, porque tudo to triste

yes, i would give my heart gladly

but each day, when she walks to the sea
she looks straight ahead, not at me

tall, tan, young, lovely
the girl from ipanema goes walking
and when she passes, i smile but she doesn't see

por causa do amor

she just doesn't see

nem olha para mim

she never sees me

por causa do amori know i stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
and if we go some place to dance, i know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
and then i go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "i love you"
i can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
and though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

i practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
but then i think i'll wait until the evening gets late, and i'm alone with you

the time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
and then i go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "i love you"

the time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
and then i go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "i love you"

"i love you"
"i love you"
"i love you"
"i love you"
"i love you"some day, when i'm awfully low
when the world is cold
i will feel a glow just thinking of you
and the way you look tonight
yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
and your cheeks so soft
there is nothing for me, but to love you
and the way you look tonight
with each word, your tenderness grows
tearing my fear apart
and that laugh wrinkles your nose
touches my foolish heart
lovely; never, ever change
keep that breathless charm
won't you please arrange it? cause i love you
just the way you look tonight

and that laugh that wrinkles your nose
it touches my foolish heart
lovely, don't you ever change
keep that breathless charm
won't you please arrange it? cause i love you
a just the way you look tonight
mm mm, mm mm
just the way you look tonightcome fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
if you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far bombay
come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

come fly with me, let's float down to peru
in llama land, there's a one man band, and he'll toot his flute for you
come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

once i get you up there, where the air is rarefied
we'll just glide, starry eyed
once i get you up there, i'll be holding you so near
you may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

weather wise, it's such a lovely day
just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to acapulco bay
it's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away


once i get you up there, where the air is rarefied
we'll just glide, starry eyed
once i get you up there, i'll be holding you so near
you may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

weather wise, it's such a lovely day
you just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to acapulco bay
it's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly

pack up, let's fly awayi've got you under my skin
i've got you deep in the heart of me
so deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
i've got you under my skin
i tried so not to give in
i said to myself, 'this affair never will go so well'
but why should i try to resist when, baby, i know so well
i've got you under my skin

i'd sacrifice anything, come what might
for the sake of having you near
in spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
and repeats, repeats in my ear

"don't you know little fool, you never can win?
use your mentality, wake up to reality"
but each time that i do, just the thought of you
makes me stop before i begin
'cause i've got you under my skin

i would sacrifice anything, come what might
for the sake of having you near
in spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
and repeats, how it yells in my ear

"don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
why not use your mentality? step up, wake up to reality"
but each time i do, just the thought of you
makes me stop just before i begin
'cause i've got you under my skin
yes, i've got you, under my skinhave yourself a merry little christmas
let your heart be light
next year all our troubles
will be out of sight

have yourself a merry little christmas
make the yuletide gay
next year all our troubles
will be miles away

once again, as in olden days
happy golden days of yore
faithful friends who are dear to us
will be near to us once more

someday soon we all will be together
if the fates allow
until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
so have yourself a merry little christmas nowmy funny valentine
sweet comic valentine
you make me smile with my heart
your looks are laughable
unphotographable
yet you're my favorite work of art
is your figure less than greek
is your mouth a little weak
when you open it to speak
are you smart?
but don't change a hair for me
not if you care for me
stay, little valentine, stay
each day is valentine's day
is your figure less than greek
is your mouth a little weak
when you open it to speak
are you smart?
but don't change a hair for me
not if you care for me
stay, little valentine, stay
each day is valentine's daywhen i was seventeen
it was a very good year
it was a very good year for small town girls
and soft summer nights
we'd hide from the lights
on the village green
when i was seventeen

when i was twenty one
it was a very good year
it was a very good year for city girls
who lived up the stair
with all that perfumed hair
and it came undone
when i was twenty one

when i was thirty five
it was a very good year
it was a very good year for blue blooded girls
of independent means
we'd ride in limousines
their chauffeurs would drive
when i was thirty five

but now the days are short
i'm in the autumn of the year
and now i think of my life as vintage wine
from fine old kegs
from the brim to the dregs
it poured sweet and clear
it was a very good yearstrangers in the night exchanging glances
wondering in the night, what were the chances?
we'd be sharing love before the night was through
something in your eyes was so inviting
something in your smile was so exciting
something in my heart told me i must have you
strangers in the night
two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and
ever since that night we've been together
lovers at first sight, in love forever
it turned out so right for strangers in the night

love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away
ever since that night we've been together
lovers at first sight, in love forever
it turned out so right for strangers in the night
dooby doooby doo and other scat to endblue moon, you saw me standin' alone
without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
blue moon, you knew just what i was there for
you heard me sayin' a prayer for
someone i really could care for
and then there suddenly appeared before me
the only one my arms will hold
i heard somebody whisper "please adore me"
and when i looked, the moon had turned to gold
blue moon, now i'm no longer alone
without a dream in my heart
without a love of my own
and then there suddenly appeared before me
the only one my arms will ever hold
i heard somebody whisper "please adore me"
and when i looked, the moon had turned to gold
blue moon, now i'm no longer alone
without a dream in my heart
without a love of my own
blue moon, now i'm no longer alone
without a dream in my heart
without a love of my ownthey call you lady luck
but there is room for doubt
at times you have a very un lady like way
of running out
you're on this date with me
the pickin's have been lush
and yet before the evening is over
you might give me the brush
you might forget your manners
you might refuse to stay
and so the best that i can do is pray
luck be lady tonight
luck be lady tonight
luck if you've been a lady to begin with
luck be a lady tonight
luck let a gentleman see
just how nice a dame you can be
i know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
luck be a lady with me

and blow on some other guy's dice
lets keep this party polite

stick with me baby, i'm the guy that you came in with
luck be lady tonight
a lady never flirts with strangers

ooh, you make me feel so youngoh, the weather outside is frightful
but the fire is so delightful
and since we've no place to go
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
it doesn't show signs of stopping
and i brought some corn for popping
the lights are turned down low
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

when we finally kiss goodnight
how i'll hate to go out in the storm
but if you really hold me tight
all the way home i'll be warm

the fire is slowly dying
and my dear, we're still goodbying
but as long as you love me so
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

he doesn't care if it's in below
he's sitting by the fire's gloosy glow
he don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
he just says, "let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"
 let it snow  
oooooh wee goes the storm
why should he worry when he's nice and warm
his gal by his side and the lights turned low
he just says, "let it snow, let it snow"
 i don't care  

the weather outside is frightful
but that fire is ummm... delightful
since we've no place to go
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
it doesn't show signs of stopping
and i've brought lots of corn for popping
the lights are way down low
so let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 
 let it snow  

when we've finally say goodnight
how i'll hate going out in a storm
but if you'll only hold me tight
all the way home i'll be warm

the fire is slowly dying
and my dear we're still goodbying
long as you love me so
let it snow, let it snow, let it snow next time you're found, with your chin on the ground
there a lot to be learned, so look around
just what makes that little old ant
think he'll move that rubber tree plant
anyone knows an ant, can't
move a rubber tree plant
but he's got high hopes, he's got high hopes
he's got high apple pie, in the sky hopes
so any time you're gettin' low
'stead of lettin' go
just remember that ant
oops, there goes another rubber tree plant
when troubles call, and your back's to the wall
there a lot to be learned, that wall could fall
once there was a silly old ram
thought he'd punch a hole in a dam
no one could make that ram, scram
he kept buttin' that dam
'cause he had high hopes, he had high hopes
he had high apple pie, in the sky hopes
so any time you're feelin' bad
'stead of feelin' sad
just remember that ram
oops there goes a billion kilowatt dam
all problems just a toy balloon
they'll be bursted soon
they're just bound to go pop
oops, there goes another problem kerplopwhy do i do just as you say?
why must i just give you your way?
why do i sigh?
why don't i try to forget?
it must have been that something lovers call fate
kept me saying, "i had to wait"
i saw them all
just couldn't fall 'til we met
it had to be you
it had to be you
i wandered around and i finally found
the somebody who could make me be true
and could make me be blue
and even be glad just to be sad thinking of you
some others i've seen
might never been mean
might never be crossed or try to be bossed
but they wouldn't do
for nobody else gave me a thrill
with all your faults, i love you still
it had to be you, wonderful you
it had to be you
for nobody else gave me a thrill
with all your faults, i love you still
it had to be you, wonderful you
it had to be youthe falling leaves
drift by the window
the autumn leaves
of red and gold
i see your lips
the summer kisses
the sunburned hands
i used to hold
since you went away
the days grow long
and soon i'll hear
old winter's song
but i miss you most of all
my darling
when autumn leaves
start to fallin the wee small hours of the morning
while the whole wide world is fast asleep
you lie awake and think about the girl
and never, ever think of counting sheep

when your lonely heart has learned its lesson
you'd be hers if only she would call
in the wee small hours of the morning
that's the time you miss her most of all


when your lonely heart has learned its lesson
you'd be hers if only she would call
in the wee small hours of the morning
that's the time you miss her most of allout of the tree of life i just picked me a plum
you came along and everything's startin' to hum
still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
you think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
a wait till the warm up's underway
wait till our lips have met
and wait till you see that sunshine day
you ain't seen nothin' yet
the best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
come the day you're mine
i'm gonna teach you to fly
we've only tasted the wine
we're gonna drain the cup dry
wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
you think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
a wait till you're locked in my embrace
wait till i draw you near
a wait till you see that sunshine place
ain't nothin' like it here
the best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
the best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
come the day you're mine
and you're gonna be minequiet nights of quiet stars
quiet chords from my guitar
floating on the silence that surrounds us
quiet thoughts and quiet dreams
quiet walks by quiet streams
and a window looking on the mountains and the sea, oh how lovely
this is where i want to be
here with you so close to me
until the final flicker of life's ember
i who was lost and lonely
believing life was only
a bitter tragic joke, have found with you, the meaning of existence, oh my love
i who was lost and lonely
believing life was only
a bitter tragic joke, have found with you, the meaning of existence, oh my loveshe gets too hungry for dinner at eight
she likes the theatre and never comes late
she never bothers with people she'd hate
that's why the lady is a tramp
doesn't like crap games with barons or earls
won't go to harlem in ermine and pearls
won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
that's why the lady is a tramp
she likes the free fresh wind in her hair
life without care
she's broke and it's oke
hates california, it's cold and it's damp
that's why the lady is a tramp
she gets too hungry to wait for dinner at eight
she loves the theatre but never comes late
she'd never bother with people she'd hate
that's why the lady is a tramp
she'll have no crap games with sharpies and frauds
and she won't go to harlem in lincolns or fords
and she won't dish the dirt with the rest of the broads
that's why the lady is a tramp
she loves the free fresh wind in her hair
life without care
she's broke but it's oke
hates california, it's so cold and so damp
that's why the lady, that's why the lady
that's why the lady is a trampl is for the way you look at me
o is for the only one i see
v is very, very extraordinary
e is even more than anyone that you adore can
love is all that i can give to you
love is more than just a game for two
two in love can make it
take my heart and please don't break it
love was made for me and you
l is for the way you look at me
o is for the only one i see
v is very, very extraordinary
e is even more than anyone that you adore can
love is all that i can give to you
love is more than just a game for two
two in love can make it
take my heart and please don't break it
love was made for me and you
love was made for me and you
love was made for me and you
love was made for me and youi'm a fool to want you
i'm a fool to want you
to want a love that can't be true
a love that's there for others too

i'm a fool to hold you
such a fool to hold you
to seek a kiss not mine alone
to share a kiss the devil has known

time and time again i said i'd leave you
time and time again i went away
but then would come the time when i would need you
and once again these words i'll have to say

take me back, i love you
pity me, i need you
i know it's wrong, it must be wrong
but right or wrong i can't get along
without youthose fingers in my hair
that sly come hither stare
that strips my conscience bare
it's witchcraft
and i've got no defense for it
the heat is too intense for it
what good would common sense for it do?

'cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
and although i know it's strictly taboo
when you arouse the need in me
my heart says "yes, indeed" in me
"proceed with what you're leadin' me to"

it's such an ancient pitch
but one i wouldn't switch
'cause there's no nicer witch than you

'cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
and although i know it's strictly taboo
when you arouse the need in me
my heart says "yes, indeed" in me
"proceed with what you're leadin' me to"

it's such an ancient pitch
but one that i'd never switch
'cause there's no nicer witch than youit's quarter to three
there's no one in the place 'cept you and me
so set 'em up, joe
i got a little story i think you should know
we're drinkin' my friend to the end
of a brief episode
make it one for my baby
and one more for the road

i got the routine
put another nickel in the machine
feelin' so bad
can't you make the music easy and sad?
i could tell you a lot
but you've gotta be true to your code
just make it one for my baby
and one more for the road

you'd never know it
but buddy, i'm a kind of poet
and i've got a lot of things i'd like to say
and when i'm gloomy
won't you listen to me
till it's talked away?

well, that's how it goes
and joe, i know you're gettin' anxious to close
and thanks for the cheer
i hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
but this torch that i've found
it's gotta be drowned or it soon might explode
so make it one for my baby
and one more for the road

a day or two ago
i thought i'd take a ride
and soon miss fanny bright
was seated by my side;
the horse was lean and lank
misfortune seemed his lot
we ran into a drifted bank
and there we got upsot
a day or two ago
the story i must tell
i went out on the snow
and on my back i fell;
a gent was riding by
in a one horse open sleigh
he laughed at me as
i there sprawling laid
but quickly drove away
now the ground is white
go it while you're young
take the girls along
and sing this sleighing song
just bet a bob tailed bay
two forty as his speed
hitch him to an open sleigh
and crack  you'll take the leadthe shadow of your smile
when you have gone
will color all my dreams
and light the dawn
look into my eyes, my love, and see
all the lovely things, you are, to me
our wistful little star
it was far, too high
a teardrop kissed your lips
and so, so did i
now when i remember spring
and every little lovely thing
i will be remembering
the shadow of your smile
your lovely smileis this the real life? is this just fantasy?
caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
i'm just a poor boy, i need no sympathy
because i'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low

god works in mysterious ways...i'm just the pieces
of the man i used to be
too many bitter tears
are raining down on me
i'm far away from home
and i've been facing this alone
for much too long

oh, i feel like no one
ever told the truth to me
about growing up
and what a struggle it would be
in my tangled state of mind
i've been looking back to find
where i went wrong

too much love will kill you
if you can't make up your mind
torn between the lover
and the love you leave behind
you're headed for disaster
'cause you never read the signs
too much love will kill you every time

i'm just the shadow
of the man i used to be
and it seems like there's
no way out of this for me
i used to bring you sunshine
now all i ever do is bring you down

ooh, how would it be
if you were standing in my shoes?
can't you see that
it's impossible to choose?
no, there's no making sense of it
every way i go i'm bound to lose
oh, yes 

too much love will kill you
just as sure as none at all
it'll drain the power that's in you
make you plead and scream and crawl
and the pain will make you crazy
you're the victim of your crime
too much love will kill you every time


yes, too much love will kill you
it'll make your life a lie
yes, too much love will kill you
and you won't understand why
you'd give your life
you'd sell your soul
but here it comes again
too much love will kill you

in the end
in the endoh oh, people of the earth
"listen to the warning," the seer he said
beware the storm that gathers here
listen to the wise man

i dreamed i saw on a moonlit stair
spreading his hand on the multitude there
a man who cried for a love gone stale
and ice cold hearts of charity bare
i watched as fear took the old man's gaze
hopes of the young in troubled graves

"i see no day," i heard him say
so grey is the face of every mortal

oh oh, people of the earth
"listen to the warning," the prophet he said
for soon the cold of night will fall
summoned by your own hand
oh oh, children of the land
quicken to the new life, take my hand
ooh, fly and find the new green bough
return like the white dove

he told of death as a bone white haze
taking the lost and the unloved babe
late too late, all the wretches run
these kings of beasts now counting their days
from mother's love is the son estranged
married his own, his precious gain

the earth will shake, in two will break
and death all around will be your dowry

oh oh, people of the earth
"listen to the warning," the seer he said
for those who hear and mark my words
listen to the good plan

oh, oh
and two by two, my human zoo
they'll be running for to come
running for to come out of the rain
oh, flee for your life
who heed me not, let all your treasure make you
oh, fear for your life
deceive you not, the fires of hell will take you
should death await you

ah, people can you hear me?
and now i know and now i know
and now i know, i know
i know that you can hear me
and now i know, now i know
now i know, now i know
now i know, now i know

i know it's not much, but it's the best i can do
my gift is my song, and this one's for you

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple, but now that it's done
i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world

i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
but the sun's been quite kind while i wrote this song
it's for people like you that keep it turned on
so excuse me forgetting, but these things i do
you see, i've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
anyway, the thing is, what i really mean
yours are the sweetest eyes i've ever seen

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple, but now that it's done
i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you're in the world

i hope you don't mind, i hope you don't mind
that i put down in words

to set you on your feet again

mongrels who ain't got a penny
sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

and did you think this fool could never win?
well look at me, i'm a coming back again
i got a taste of love in a simple way
and if you need to know while i'm still standing
you just fade away

don't you know i'm still standing better than i ever did?
looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
and i'm still standing after all this time
picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

i'm still standing  yeah, yeah, yeah 
i'm still standing  yeah, yeah, yeah 

once, i never coulda hoped to win
you starting down the road, leaving me again
the threats you made were meant to cut me down
and if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

you know i'm still standing better than i ever did

when the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
an enchanted moment, and it sees me through
it's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

and can you feel the love tonight?
it is where we are
it's enough for this wide eyed wanderer
that we got this far
and can you feel the love tonight?
how it's laid to rest
it's enough to make kings and vagabonds
believe the very best

there's a time for everyone if they only learn
that the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
there's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
when the heart of this star crossed voyager beats in time with yours

and can you feel the love tonight?
it is where we are
it's enough for this wide eyed wanderer
that we got this far
and can you feel the love tonight?
how it's laid to rest
it's enough to make kings and vagabonds
believe the very best

it's enough to make kings and vagabonds
believe the very besti can't light no more of your darkness
all my pictures seem to fade to black and white
i'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
frozen here on the ladder of my life

too late to save myself from falling
i took a chance and changed your way of life
but you misread my meanin' when i met you
closed the door and left me blinded by the light

don't let the sun go down on me
although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
i'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
but losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

i can't find, oh, the right romantic line
but see me once and see the way i feel
don't discard me just because you think i mean you harm
but these cuts i have, oh, they need love to help them heal

don't let the sun go down on me
although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
i'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
but losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

don't let the sun go down on me
although i search myself, it's always someone else i see
i'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah
but losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on megoodbye, norma jeane
though i never knew you at all
you had the grace to hold yourself
while those around you crawled
they crawled out of the woodwork
and they whispered into your brain
they set you on the treadmill
and they made you change your name

and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would've liked to know you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did

loneliness was tough
the toughest role you ever played
hollywood created a superstar
and pain was the price you paid
and even when you died
oh, the press still hounded you
all the papers had to say
was that marilyn was found in the nude

and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would've liked to know you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did

goodbye, norma jeane
though i never knew you at all
you had the grace to hold yourself
while those around you crawled
goodbye, norma jeane
from the young man in the 22nd row
who sees you as something more than sexual
more than just our marilyn monroe

and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would've liked to know you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever diddaniel is travelin' tonight on a plane

oh, and i can see daniel wavin' goodbye
god, it looks like daniel

they say spain is pretty, though i've never been
and daniel says it's the best place he's ever seen
oh, and he should know, he's been there enough
lord, i miss daniel
oh, i miss him so much

oh, daniel, my brother, you are older than me
do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
your eyes have died, but you see more than i
daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky

oh, daniel, my brother, you are older than me
do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?

ma, tell me when the boys get here
it's seven o'clock and i wanna rock
wanna get a belly full of beer
my old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
and my old lady, she don't care
my sister looks cute in her braces and boots
a handful of grease in her hair

oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
we had it with your discipline
oh, saturday night's alright for fighting
get a little action in
get about as oiled as a diesel train
gonna set this dance alight
'cause saturday night's the night i like
saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh

well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
i'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
i may use a little muscle to get what i need
i may sink a little drink and shout out, "she's with me "
a couple of the sounds that i really like
are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
i'm a juvenile product of the working class
whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
we had it with your discipline
saturday night's alright for fighting
get a little action in

me and susie had so much fun
holding hands and skimming stones
had an old gold chevy and a place of my own
but the biggest kick i ever got
was doing a thing called the crocodile rock
while the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
we were hopping and bopping to the crocodile rock

well, crocodile rocking is something shocking
when your feet just can't keep still
i never knew me a better time, and i guess i never will
oh, lawdy mama, those friday nights
when susie wore her dresses tight
and the crocodile rocking was out of sight

laa, la la la la laa
la la la la laa
la la la la laa

but the years went by and the rock just died
susie went and left us for some foreign guy
long nights crying by the record machine
dreaming of my chevy and my old blue jeans
but they'll never kill the thrills we've got
burning up to the crocodile rock
learning fast as the weeks went past
we really thought the crocodile rock would last

well, crocodile rocking is something shocking
when your feet just can't keep still
i never knew me a better time, and i guess i never will
oh, lawdy mama, those friday nights

don't look at it like it's forever
between you and me, i could honestly say
that things can only get better

and while i'm away
dust out the demons inside
and it won't be long before you and me run
to the place in our hearts where we hide

and i guess that's why they call it the blues
time on my hands could be time spent with you
laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
rollin' like thunder under the covers
and i guess that's why they call it the blues

just stare into space
picture my face in your hands
live for each second without hesitation
and never forget i'm your man

wait on me, girl
cry in the night if it helps
but more than ever, i simply love you
more than i love life itself

may you ever grow in our hearts
you were the grace that placed itself
where lives were torn apart
you called out to our country
and you whispered to those in pain
now you belong to heaven
and the stars spell out your name

and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never fading with the sunset
when the rain set in
and your footsteps will always fall here
along england's greenest hills
your candle's burned out long before
your legend ever will

loveliness we've lost
these empty days without your smile
this torch, we'll always carry
for our nation's golden child
and even though we try
the truth brings us to tears
all our words cannot express
the joy you brought us through the years

and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never fading with the sunset
when the rain set in
and your footsteps will always fall here
along england's greenest hills
your candle's burned out long before
your legend ever will

goodbye england's rose
may you ever grow in our hearts
you were the grace that placed yourself
where lives were torn apart
goodbye england's rose
from a country lost without your soul
who'll miss the wings of your compassion
more than you will ever know

and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never fading with the sunset
when the rain set in
and your footsteps will always fall here
along england's greenest hills

your footsteps will always fall here
along england's greenest hills
your candle's burned out long before
your legend ever willit's a human sign
when things go wrong
when the scent of her lingers
and temptation's strong
into the boundary
of each married man
sweet deceit comes callin'
and negativity lands

cold, cold heart
hardened by you
some things look better, baby
just passin' through

and it's no sacrifice
just a simple word
it's two hearts livin'
in two separate worlds
but it's no sacrifice
no sacrifice
it's no sacrifice at all

mutual misunderstandin'
after the fact
sensitivity builds a prison
in the final act
we lose direction
no stone unturned
no tears to damn you
when jealousy burns

cold, cold heart
hardened by you
some things look better, baby
just passin' through

and it's no sacrifice

and it's one more beer, and i don't hear you anymore
we've all gone crazy lately
my friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor  ooh 

and someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear  sugar bear

altar bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
you're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
fly away, high away, bye bye  ooh 


i never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
a slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
i'm strangled by your haunted social scene
just a pawn out played by a dominating queen
it's four o'clock in the morning, damn it  listen to me good
i'm sleepin' with myself tonight
saved in time, thank god my music's still alive
 oh  

someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear

fly away, high away, bye bye  ooh 


and i would've walked head on into the deep end of the river
clingin' to your stocks and bonds
payin' your h.p. demands forever
they're comin' in the mornin' with a truck to take me home
someone saved my life tonight
someone saved my life tonight
someone saved my life tonight
someone saved my life tonight
someone saved my life tonight
so save your strength, and run the field you play alone

bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
looking for an answer, trying to find a sign
until i saw your city lights, honey, i was blind

they said, get back, honky cat
better get back to the woods
but, i quit those days and my redneck ways
and, oh, change is gonna do me good
you better get back, honky cat
living in the city ain't where it's at
it's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
it's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine

well, i read some books and i read some magazines
about those high class ladies down in new orleans
and all the fools back home, well, said i was a fool
they said, oh, "believe in the lord" is the golden rule

runnin' fast along the sand
a spirit born of earth and water
fire flyin' from your hands
in the instant that you love someone
in the second that the hammer hits
reality runs up your spine
and the pieces finally fit

and all i ever needed was the one
like freedom fields, where wild horses run
when stars collide like you and i
no shadows block the sun
you're all i've ever needed
baby, you're the one

there are caravans we follow
drunken nights in dark hotels
when chances breathe between the silence
where sex and love no longer gel, oh
for each man, in his time, is cain
until he walks along the beach
and sees his future in the water
a long, lost heart within his reach

and all i ever needed was the one
like freedom fields, where wild horses run
when stars collide like you and i
no shadows block the sun
you're all i've ever needed
ooh, baby, you're the one

what does it feel like when you're dancing?

i can't really explain it
i haven't got the words
it's a feeling that you can't control
i suppose it's like forgetting, losing who you are
and at the same time something makes you whole
it's like that there's a music playing in your ear
and i'm listening, and i'm listening and then i disappear
and then i feel a change
like a fire deep inside
something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
and suddenly i'm flying, flying like a bird
like electricity, electricity
sparks inside of me
and i'm free i'm free
it's a bit like being angry
it's a bit like being scared
confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
it's like when you've been crying
and you're empty and you're full
i don't know what it is, it's hard to tell
it's like that there's a music playing in your ear
but the music is impossible, impossible to hear
but then i feel it move me
like a burning deep inside
something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
and suddenly i'm flying, flying like a bird
like electricity, electricity
sparks inside of me
and i'm free i'm free
electricity, sparks inside of me
and i'm free, i'm free
i'm free. free i'm freei'm getting bored
being part of mankind
there's not a lot to do no more
this race is a waste of time

swarming around like flies

on the state of teenage bluesfrom the day we arrive on the planet
and blinking, step into the sun
there's more to see than can ever be seen
more to do than can ever be done
some say, "eat or be eaten"
some say, "live and let live"
but all are agreed as they join the stampede
you should never take more than you give

in the circle of life
it's the wheel of fortune
it's the leap of faith
it's the band of hope
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle, the circle of life

some of us fall by the wayside
and some of us soar to the stars
and some of us sail through our troubles
and some have to live with the scars
there's far too much to take in here
more to find than can ever be found
but the sun rollin' high through the sapphire sky
keeps great and small on the endless round

in the circle of life
it's the wheel of fortune
it's the leap of faith
it's the band of hope

 love lies bleeding 
the roses in the window box have tilted to one side
everything about this house was born to grow and die
oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
you said, "i'm sorry, honey, if i don't change the pace
i can't face another day"

and love lies bleedin' in my hands
oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
i was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
but my guitar couldn't hold you, so i split the band
love lies bleedin' in my hands

i wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
like all the burnin' hoops of fire that you and i passed through
you're a bluebird on a telegraph line, i hope you're happy now
well, if the wind of change comes down your way, girl
you'll make it back somehow

and love lies bleedin' in my hands
oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
i was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
but my guitar couldn't hold you, so i split the band

on your rock and roll tv
but today the way i play the game is not the same, no way

i just hope you understand
sometimes the clothes do not make the man

we had every big shot goodtime band on the run, boy
we were living in a fantasy
we won the race, got out of the place
went back home, got a brand new face for the boys on mtv
but today the way i play the game has got to change oh yeah

but it feels like the road to hell
when i knew which side my bread was buttered
i took the knife as well
posing for another picture
everybody's got to sell
but when you shake your ass
they notice fast
and some mistakes were built to last
that's what you get
i say that's what you get

just the way it's got to be
lose the face now
i've got to livewell, i guess it would be nice if i could touch your body
i know not everybody has got a body like you
but i gotta think twice before i give my heart away
and i know all the games you play because i played them too

oh, but i need some time off from that emotion
time to pick my heart up off the floor
oh, when that love comes down without devotion
well it takes a strong man, baby
but i'm showin' you the door

'cause i gotta' have faith
i gotta have faith
because i gotta have faith, faith, faith
i got to have faith, faith, faith

baby, i know you're askin' me to stay
say, "please, please, please don't go away"
you say i'm givin' you the blues
maybe  huh  you mean every word you say
can't help but think of yesterday
and another who tied me down to loverboy rules

before this river becomes an ocean
before you throw my heart back on the floor
oh, baby, i reconsider my foolish notion
well, i need someone to hold me
but i'll wait for somethin' more

yes i gotta have faith
ooh, i gotta have faith
because i gotta have faith, faith, faith
i gotta have faith, faith, faith

i'll just have to wait
because i've got to have faith
i gotta have faith
i've got to, got to, got to have faith

before this river becomes an ocean
before you throw my heart back on the floor
oh, oh, baby, i reconsider my foolish notion
well, i need someone to hold me
but i'll wait for somethin' more

'cause i gotta' have faith
ooh, i gotta have faith
because i gotta have faith, faith, faith
i gotta have faith, faith, faiththat's all i wanted
something special, someone sacred in your eyes
for just one moment
to be bold and naked at your side

sometimes i think that you'll never understand me
maybe this time is forever, say it can be, whoa

that's all you wanted
somethin' special, someone sacred in your life
just for one moment, to be warm and naked at my side

sometimes i think that you'll never understand me
 understand me 
but somethin' tells me together, we'd be happy, whoa baby

i will be your father figure
put your tiny hand in mine
i will be your preacher teacher
anything you have in mind
i will be your father figure
i have had enough of crime
i will be the one who loves you
'til the end of time

that's all i wanted
but sometimes love can be mistaken for a crime
that's all i wanted
just to see my baby's blue eyes shine

this time i think that my lover understands me
 understands me 
if we have faith in each other then we can be strong

i will be your father figure
put your tiny hand in mine
i will be your preacher teacher
anything you have in mind
i will be your father figure
i have had enough of crime
i will be the one who loves you
'til the end of time

if you are the desert, i'll be the sea
if you ever hunger, hunger for me
whatever you ask for, that's what i'll be
so when you remember the ones who have lied
who said that they cared but then
laughed as you cried
beautiful darling, don't think of me
because all i ever wanted
it's in your eyes baby  baby 
and love can't lie, no

greet me with the eyes of a child
my love is always tellin' me so
heaven is a kiss and a smile
just hold on, hold on
i won't let you go, my baby

i will be your father figure
put your tiny hand in mine
i will be your preacher teacher
anything you have in mind
i will be your father figure
i have had enough of crime
i will be the one who loves you
'til the end of time

i will be your father  i will be your 
i will be your  father  preacher teacher
i will be your  i'll be your daddy, oh 
i will be the one who loves you
'til the end of timei've had enough of danger
and people on the streets
i'm lookin' out for angels
just tryin' to find some peace
now i think it's time
that you let me know
so if you love me
say you love me
but if you don't
just let me go

'cause teacher
there are things that i don't want to learn
and the last one i had
made me cry
so i don't want to learn to
hold you, touch you
think that you're mine
because it ain't no joy
for an uptown boy
whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

when you were just a stranger
and i was at your feet
i didn't feel the danger
now i feel the heat
that look in your eyes
telling me "no"
so you think that you love me
know that you need me
i wrote the song, i know it's wrong
just let me go

'cause teacher
there are things that i don't want to learn
and the last one i had
made me cry
so i don't want to learn to
hold you, touch you
think that you're mine
because it ain't no joy
for an uptown boy
whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

so when you say that you need me
that you'll never leave me
i know you're wrong, you're not that strong
let me go

and teacher
there are things that i still have to learn
but the one thing i have is my pride
oh, so i don't want to learn to
hold you, touch you
think that you're mine
because there ain't no joy
for an uptown boy
who just isn't willin' to try

i'm so cold inside
maybe just one more try duh du du duh
duh du du duh... 
as around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
and the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
just as hate knows love's the cure
you can rest your mind assured
that i'll be loving you always
as now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
but in passing we'll grow older every day
just as all is born is blue
you know what i say is true
that i'll be loving you always

until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky  always 
until the ocean covers every mountain high  hmmm uh, this is gonna be always 
until the day that eight times eight times eight is four  you know it's gonna be always 
until the day that is the day that i'm no more

did you know that true love asks for nothing?
her acceptance is the way we pay  ooooh, baby 
did you know that life has given love a guarantee?
to last through forever  forever , another day

as today i know i'm living but tomorrow  yeahhhhh 
could make me the past but that i mustn't fear  cause you're here 
now i know deep in my mind
the love of me i've felt behind

and i'll be loving you always

until the trees and seas just up and fly away  i'll be loving you forever 
until the day that eight times eight times eight is four  alllways 
until the day that is the day that i'm no more  extended   yeahhhhh 

did you know that true love asks for nothing?  true love don't want a thing 
her acceptance is the way we pay  ohhhhh, baby 
did you know that life has given love a guarantee?
to last forever  another day 
as around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
and the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
now i know deep in my mind
the love of me i've left behind
and i'll be loving you always

looking for some affirmationin the past there were arguments for and against casual sex. then it became a question of morality. these days it can be a question of life or death. it's as simple as that. and this song is not about casual sex

with a promise  oh 
i know we can come together
but the question is will we ever ever?
ohhh together
you and me
i want your lovekindness in your eyes
i guess you heard me cry
you smiled at me like jesus to a child
i'm blessed i know
heaven sent and heaven stole
you smiled at me like jesus to a child
and what have i learned from all this pain
i thought i never feel the same about anyone or anything again
but now i know

when you find a love
when you know that it exists
then the lover that you miss
will come to you on those cold, cold nights
when you've been loved
when you know it holds such bliss
then the lover that you kissed
will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

sadness in my eyes
no one guessed and no one tried
you smiled at me like jesus to a child
loveless and cold
with your last breath you saved my soul
you smiled at me like jesus to a child
and what have i learned from all these tears
i've waited for you all those years
then just when it began he took your love away
but i still say

when you find a love
when you know that it exists
then the lover that you miss
will come to you on those cold, cold nights
when you've been loved
when you know it holds such bliss
then the lover that you kissed
will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

so the words you could not say
i'll sing them for you
and the love we would have made
i'll make it for two
for every single memory
has become a part of me
you will always be my love
well i've been loved so i know just what love is
and the lover that i kissed is always by my side
oh the lover i still miss... was jesus to a childyou are far
when i could have been your star
you listened to people
who scared you to death and from my heart
strange that you were strong enough
to even make a start
but you'll never find peace of mind
'til you listen to your heart

people
you can never change the way they feel
better let them do just what they will
for they will
if you let them steal your heart from you
people
will always make a lover feel a fool
but you knew i loved you
we could have shown them all
we should have seen love through

fooled me with the tears in your eyes
covered me with kisses and lies
so goodbye
but please don't take my heart

you are far
i'm never gonna be your star
i'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
maybe i'll be strong enough
i don't know where to start
but i'll never find peace of mind
while i listen to my heart

people
you can never change the way they feel
better let them do just what they will
for they will
if you let them steal your heart from you
people
will always make a lover feel a fool
but you knew i loved you
we could have shown them all
we should have seen love through
ba da da ah ah ah

but remember this
every other kiss
that you ever give
long as we both live
when you need the hand of another man
one you really can surrender with
i will wait for you like i always do
there's something there
that can't compare with any other

you are far
when i could have been your star
you listened to people
who scared you to death and from my heart
strange that i was wrong enough
to think you'd love me too
guess you were kissing a fool
you must have been kissing a foolthese are the days of the open hand, they will not be the last
look around now
these are the days of the beggars and the choosers
this is the year of the hungry man, whose place is in the past
hand in hand with ignorance and legitimate excuses
the rich declare themselves poor, and most of us are not sure
if we have too much, but we'll take our chances
'cause god's stopped keeping score
i guess somewhere along the way he must have let us all out to play
turned his back, and all god's children crept out the back door
and it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
and the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
well maybe we should all be praying for time
these are the days of the empty hand, oh you hold on to what you can
and charity is a coat you wear twice a year
this is the year of the guilty man, your television takes a stand
and you find that what was over there is over here
so you scream from behind your door
say "what's mine is mine and not yours"
i may have too much but i'll take my chances
'cause god's stopped keeping score
and you cling to the things they sold you
did you cover your eyes when they told you
that he can't come back
'cause he has no children to come back for
it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
and the wounded skies above say it's much too late
so maybe we should all be praying for timewhen your heart's in someone else's hands
monkey see and monkey do
their wish is your command
not to blame
everyone's the same
all you do is love and love is all you do
i should know by now the way i fought for you
you're not to blame, everyone's the same
i know you think that you're safe
mister
harmless deception
that keeps love at bay
it's the ones who resist that we most want to kiss
wouldn't you say?
cowboys and angels
they all have the time for you
why should i imagine that i'd be a find for you
why should i imagine
that i'd have something to say
but that scar on your face
that beautiful face of yours
in your heart there's a trace
of someone before
when your heart's in someone else's plans
things you say and things you do
that they don't understand
it's such a shame
always ends the same
you can call it love but i don't think it's true
you should know by now
i'm not the boy for you
you're not to blame
always ends the same
i know you think that you're safe
sister
harmless affection that keeps things this way
it's the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss
who will pay
cowboys and angels
they all have the time for you
why should i imagine that i was designed for you
why should i believe
that you would stay
but that scar on your face
that beautiful face of yours
don't you think that i'd know
they've hurt you, before
take this man to your place
maybe his hands will help you forget
please be stronger than your past
the future may still give you a chanceno more lying friends
wanting tragic ends
though they do pretend
they won't go when i go
all those bleeding hearts
with sorrows to impart
were right here from the start
and they won't go when i go

and i'll go where i've longed
to go so long away from tears

gone from painful cries
away from saddened eyes
along with him i'll bide
because they won't go when i go
big men feeling small
weak ones standing tall
i will watch them fall
they won't go when i go

unclean minds mislead the pure
the innocent will leave for sure
for them there is a resting place
people sinning just for fun
they will never see the sun
for they can never show their faces
there ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
who will take more than he will give
he ain't hardly gonna give
the greed of man will be far away from me
and my soul will be free
they won't go when i go
since my soul conceived
all that i believe
the kingdom i will see
cause they won't go when i go
when i go
where i'll go
no one can keep me
from my destinyshe takes the back road and the lane
past the school that has not changed
in all this time
she thinks of when the boy was young
all the battles she had won
just to give him life
that man
she loved that man
for all his life
but now we meet to take him flowers
and only god knows why
for what's the use in pressing palms
when children fade in mother's arms
it's a cruel world
we've so much to loose
and what we have to learn we rarely choose
so if it's god who took her son
he cannot be the one living in her mind
take care my love, she said
don't think that god is dead
take care my love, she said
you have been loved
if i was weak, forgive me
but i was terrified
you brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love
the kind that makes devils cry
so these days
my life has changed
and i'll be fine
but she just sits and counts the hours
searching for her crime
so what's the use of pressing palms
if you won't keep such love from harm
it's a cruel world
you've so much to prove
and heaven helps the ones who wait for you
well i've no daughters, i've no sons
guess i'm the only one
living in my life
take care my love, he said
don't think that god is dead
take care my love, he said
you have been loved i was mixed up when you came to me
too broke to fix, said daddy get you gone
i'm missing my baby
still missing my baby
i was stitched up by the hands of fate
said how you gonna make it on your own if luck is a lady?
maybe luck is a lady
i was going down for the third time
my heart was broken, i was not open to your suggestions
i had so many questions
that you just kissed away
tell me, i guess that cupid was in disguise
the day you walked in and changed my life
i think it's amazing
the way that love can you set you free
so now i walk in the midday sun
i never thought that my savior would come
i think it's amazing
i think it's amazing
i think you're amazing
you tried to save me from myself
said darling, kiss as many as you want
my love's still available
and i know you're insatiable
we're like victims of the same disease
look at your big bad daddy and your mom
and your mom, was always acting crazy
i was going down for the third time
my heart was broken
i thought that loving you was out of the question
 loving you was out of the question 
then i saw my reflection  reflection 
saying please don't let this go
tell me, i guess that cupid was in disguise
the day you walked in and changed my life
i think it's amazing
the way that love can you set you free
so now i walk in the midday sun
i never thought that my savior would come
i think it's amazing
i think you're amazing
 celebrate the love of the one you're with  x18
celebrate this life with you baby
i think you should celebrate, yeah
don't put your love in chains, baby
now i walk in the midday sun
i never thought i would see love
i think it's amazing
i think you're amazing
i said celebrate the love of the one you're with
celebrate 
celebrate 
as this life gets colder
and the devil inside
tells you to give up, baby
now i walk in the midday sunoh, oh oh, ooh oh
ah ah

but the very next day, you gave it away
this year, to save me from tears

oh oh

a crowded room, friends with tired eyes
i'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
my god, i thought you were someone to rely on
me? i guess i was a shoulder to cry on
a face on a lover with a fire in his heart
a man under cover, but you tore me apart
ooh ooh, now i've found a real love
you'll never fool me again
last christmas, i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away  you gave it away 
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special  special 
last christmas, i gave you my heart
but the very next day, you gave it away  you gave meaway 
this year, to save me from tears
i'll give it to someone special  special 
a face on a lover with a fire in his heart  i gave you mine 
a man under cover, but you tore him apart
maybe next year, i'll give it to someone

you don't have to hide that you care
you just have to believe
in this kind of love
everybody's telling me that these are dangerous times
but you and me, can't you see baby?
maybe we have better take a little care with this love

cause i can't be happy without you
then i'll be the one
now that i've found you

for you and me, can't you see baby?
people got to take a little bit of care when they got doubt
don't let it go, no, never, no
and all i know

when you look at me
how can you ask if i love you?

so i'm telling you
now that i've found you

i'd say love would keep us from pain
had i been there, had i been there
i would promise you all of my life
but to lose you would cut like a knife
so i don't dare, no i don't dare
cause i've never come close in all of these years
you are the only one to stop my tears
and i'm so scared, i'm so scared

take me back in time maybe i can forget
turn a different corner and we never would have met
would you care
i don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
little by little you've brought me to my knees
don't you care
no i've never come close in all of these years
you are the only one to stop my tears
i'm so scared of this love
and if all that there is, is this fear of being used
i should go back to being lonely and confused
if i could, i would, i swearlet me tell you a secret
put it in your heart and then keep it
something that i want you to know
do something for me
listen to my simple story
and maybe we'll have something to show

like the trembling heart of a captive bird

some of us will change their lives
some of us still have nothing to show
nothing baby
but memories
and if these wounds
they are self inflicted
i don't really know
how my poor heart could have
protected me

i said, maybe your mama gave you up, boy
 it's the same old same old 
maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl
 say, how much is enough? 
star people
never forget you're secret's safe with me
just look at all the wonderful people
trying to forget they had to pay for what you see
it's a dream
with a nightmare stuck in the middle
but listen, brother, where would you be
without all this attention?
you'd die, i'd die, we'd die
wouldn't we?
well wouldn't we?
 you're a star 
i'm talking to you
i'm talking to you
 you're a star 

i said, maybe your mama gave you up, boy
 it's the same old same old 
maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl
 how much is enough 
you only wanted them to love you
you may have been living in a dream
and as the demons tower above you
you bite your tongue when you really wanna scream
 how much is enough? 
look at me
i said
talk about your mother
talk about your father
talk about the people who have made you what you are
talk about your teacher
the bully boy who beat you
talk about the people who have paid for that new sports car
you're a big, big, big, big star
look at you
 how much is enough? 
how much is enough?
did you get off on a bad foot, baby?
do you have a little tale to tell?
did you get off on a bad foot?
bad, bad foot?
is that why you're a star?
is that what makes a star?
 how much is enough 
how much is enough?
 did you get off on a bad foot, baby?
do you have a little tale to tell?
how much is enough? 
how much is enough?
babe
now, nothing comes from nothing, baby
that fame and fortune's heaven sent
and who gives a fuck about your problems, darling
'cause you can pay the rent?
how much is enough?tonight
do we have to fight again
tonight?
i just want to go to sleep
turn out the light
but you want to carry grudges
oh, nine times out of ten
oh, i see the storm approaching
long before the rain starts falling
tonight
does it have to be the old thing
tonight?
oh, it's late, too late
to chase the rainbow that you're after
i'd like to find a compromise
oh, and place it in your hands
my eyes are blind, my ears can't hear
oh, and i cannot find the time
tonight
just let the curtains close in silence
tonight
why not approach with less defiance
the man who'd love to see you smile
who'd love to see you smile
tonight
tonight
just let the curtains close in silence
tonight
why not approach with less defiance
the man who'd love to see your smile
the man who'd love to see your smile
the man who'd love to see your smile
tonight
